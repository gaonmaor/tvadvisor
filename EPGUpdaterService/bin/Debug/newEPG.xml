Homes Under the Hammer is a BBC One morning television series, which has been running since 2003. Its main presenters are Lucy Alexander and Martin Roberts, although in series three Marc Woodward and Jasmine Birtles alternated presenting duties with Alexander and Roberts. The series is the BBC's most successful show that has been shown in the 10.00am slot, regularly attaining a 30% share for new episodes.
Each episode of the show follows three properties (or two for 30-minute shows) which were bought at auction - often ones that require significant refurbishment. A cross-section of properties are featured including terraced, commercial, rural, and vacant land. The programme follows a set formula.

Doctors is a British daytime television soap opera, set in the fictional Midland town of Letherbridge, defined as being close to the city of Birmingham, following the staff and their families of a doctor's surgery.
Doctors is produced by BBC Birmingham and is screened on BBC One, with the first episode broadcast on 26 March 2000. It was created by Chris Murray, with Mal Young developing it and Carson Black the original producer. The show has been shown at lunchtime since its inception, originally at 12.30pm as a lead-in to the BBC's One O'Clock News. After it was temporarily moved to allow for extended news coverage of the September 11th 2001 attacks, its regular slot changed to 2:10 pm, following directly after Neighbours, after ratings rose to a 25% audience share. When the BBC lost Neighbours to Channel 5 in January 2008, it moved into the Australian soap's old slot of 1:45pm. For a brief trial period in Summer 2000, selected episodes from the first series were shown on Fridays at 7 pm and from 16 February 2009, the show began transmitting in high definition on BBC HD at 4:00pm the same day.

Perfection is a game show shown on BBC Two, hosted by Nick Knowles. It was first broadcast on 17 January 2011.
Four players, referred to by the host as the "Usual Suspects", compete. One contestant is chosen at random from the four to compete in the main game on stage, while the other three play against the contestant from their soundproof booth. In each of the three initial rounds of the game, the host starts by turning off the booth, so the Usual Suspects can neither hear nor see anything happening on stage. The contestant is then given four true-or-false statements to answer in 45 seconds. Once all four answers have been locked in, the booth is turned back on so the Usual Suspects can see the contestant's answers.
The host then reveals how many answers the contestant got right, but not which specific ones. If all four are correct, the contestant wins the round immediately. If the contestant got less than four correct, the Usual Suspects have the chance to change the contestant's answers, with the knowledge of how many he_she got wrong. Should the Usual Suspects correctly change the contestant's answers, they win the round. If they get one wrong though, neither contestant nor</desc>

Pointless is a quiz show shown on BBC One, hosted by Alexander Armstrong, with Richard Osman as an assistant. It has been broadcast since 24 August 2009.
Similar to Family Fortunes, contestants must give answers to a question which had previously been asked to one hundred members of the public. However, there are important differences:
The object of the game is to score as few points as possible by giving correct answers that the public have or have not given, ultimately scoring lower than other contestants. The contestants particularly try to look for answers that score no points, which are known as "Pointless" answers. Finding a Pointless Answer adds £250 to the jackpot in rounds prior to the Final, and finding a Pointless Answer in the Final wins the game.
At the beginning of the show there are four teams (five in the first series) of two players. Any team which does not reach the final of the show on their first appearance is invited back for a second (and final) appearance on the next show.
The aim of the show is to get as few points as possible, by answering questions with lesser known correct answers.

It is set in the same hospital as Casualty, Holby General, in the fictional city of Holby, and features occasional crossovers of characters and plots with both Casualty (in episodes broadcast as Casualty@Holby City) and the show's 2007 police procedural spin-off HolbyBlue.

The show follows the lives of medical and ancillary staff at the fictional Holby City Hospital. It began with eleven main characters in its first series, all of whom have since left the show. New main characters have been both written in and out of the series since, with a core of fifteen main actors employed on the serial at any given time.

Homes Under the Hammer is a BBC One morning television series, which has been running since 2003.

The series is the BBC's most successful show that has been shown in the 10.00am slot, regularly attaining a 30% share for new episodes.
Each episode of the show follows three properties (or two for 30-minute shows) which were bought at auction - often ones that require significant refurbishment. A cross-section of properties are featured including terraced, commercial, rural, and vacant land. The programme follows a set formula. One of the presenters will view the property prior to going up for auction giving their opinion on it and its potential problems as well as attractive features. A local estate agent will also be invited to give their opinion on the property. The auction will then be shown and the final sale price revealed.

Don't Get Done, Get Dom is a British reality television series which helps consumers get good deals when purchasing goods. The show lends its name from its presenter Dominic Littlewood. It is aired on BBC One and repeated on BBC Two in the UK.
Series one was first aired in June 2006 and a second series was later commissioned and began to air in June 2007. Series three began in June 2008. Series four aired for two weeks on BBC in late May to early June 2010. Series five began on 25 April 2011. Series six was shown from 9–27 April 2012.
During the show, a member of the public is "tutored" into getting a better deal on a product which they are attempting to buy; typically giving them more confidence in talking to and making deals with the store assistants and managers. Examples from the series are people purchasing video cameras and sports gear.
This is achieved by Littlewood seeing camera footage of a first attempt, and giving them pointers. After this they try another shop but this time Littlewood can communicate to the member of the public by means of a hidden earpiece.
The show also helps out people in need, who have been treated unfairly, to get deals or refunds on products or</desc>

Hardtalk (styled as HARDtalk) is a flagship BBC television programme, consisting of in-depth half-hour one-on-one interviews.
It is broadcast four days a week (Monday to Thursday) on BBC World News and the BBC News channel. Launched in 1997, much of its worldwide fame is due to its global reach via BBC World. Until early 2005, the host was Tim Sebastian, whose famous, and sometimes controversial, style of tough questioning brought a huge world audience to the show. It is normally broadcast late at night on the BBC News Channel. Until the mid-zeros, it was broadcast at around 11: 30 p.m., but in more recent times, it has been broaadcast later, at around half past twelve in the morning.
Since 2006, the show has been presented by Stephen Sackur, who was previously the BBC's correspondent in Washington and Brussels and who is an experienced interviewer who has grilled U.S. Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. He is occasionally replaced by several other well-known BBC presenters such as Zeinab Badawi, Carrie Gracie and Sarah Montague. Other occasional presenters have included Jon Sopel, David Jessel, Lyse Doucet, Nisha Pillai, Noel Thompson and Katya Adler.

Eggheads is a BBC quiz show created by 12 Yard Productions, first broadcast in 2003, and co-presented by Dermot Murnaghan and Jeremy Vine. For the 2008 series, Jeremy Vine was brought in to present on nights when Murnaghan was hosting the spinoff series Are You an Egghead? This happened again from October 2009 while Murnaghan presented the second series of the spinoff show. Since the spin-off show finished, Jeremy Vine has continued to host the second half of each series, which broadcasts 52 weeks a year. The show pits a team of five 'Eggheads' (made up from seven highly regarded quiz and game show champions, rotating each episode) against a series of teams of five 'challengers' who in each episode attempt to beat the Eggheads through a series of rounds. It is normally shown weekdays every week.
The title sequence consists of a voiceover by the host stating 'These people are amongst the greatest quiz players in Britain. Together they make up the Eggheads, arguably the most formidable quiz team in the country. The question is: can they be beaten?'

Freebase:
Great British Railway Journeys is a BBC travel documentary television series presented by Michael Portillo. The first series premiered on 4 January 2010 on BBC Two, running for 20 half-hour episodes; two further seasons followed in 2011 and in 2012, but with each season extended from 20 to 25 episodes; a fourth season is being filmed for release in early 2013. In the series, Portillo travels around the British railway network, guided by a Victorian guidebook written by George Bradshaw, and compares how the destinations have changed in Victorian and modern times.
Travelling around Great Britain by train, Portillo uses a copy of Victorian cartographer George Bradshaw's Railway Companion to compare and contrast modern Britain with that documented by Bradshaw in the 1840s, visiting recommended points of interest which would have been of interest to the Victorians. George Bradshaw was a cartographer who in 1840 became the first person to produce a comprehensive timetable and travel guide of the railway system in Great Britain, which at the time although extensive, still comprised a series of fragmented and competing railway companies and lines each publishing their own literature.

Newsnight is a BBC Television current affairs programme noted for its in-depth analysis and often robust cross-examination of senior politicians. Jeremy Paxman has been its main presenter for over two decades.
Several of the programme's editors over the years have gone on to senior positions within the BBC and elsewhere. Paxman's fellow presenters are Gavin Esler, Kirsty Wark and Emily Maitlis. Newsnight has been broadcast on BBC Two since 1980. It goes out on weekday evenings between 10:30pm and 11:20pm. Occasionally it may have an extended edition if there is an especially eventful event in the news - as happened on July 7 2011, when closure of the News of the World led to an extended version which went on until 11:35 pm. Recordings are available within the UK via the BBC website. A weekly 26-minute digest edition of Newsnight is screened on the corporation's international channel, BBC World News.
Newsnight in its current format began on 30 January 1980, although a shorter news bulletin of the same name had run in its late-night BBC2 slot during the 1970s. Its launch was delayed for four months by the Association of Broadcasting Staff, at the time the main BBC trade union.</desc>

Homes Under the Hammer is a BBC One morning television series, which has been running since 2003. Its main presenters are Lucy Alexander and Martin Roberts, although in series three Marc Woodward and Jasmine Birtles alternated presenting duties with Alexander and Roberts. The series is the BBC's most successful show that has been shown in the 10.00am slot, regularly attaining a 30% share for new episodes.
Each episode of the show follows three properties (or two for 30-minute shows) which were bought at auction - often ones that require significant refurbishment. A cross-section of properties are featured including terraced, commercial, rural, and vacant land. The programme follows a set formula. One of the presenters will view the property prior to going up for auction giving their opinion on it and its potential problems as well as attractive features. A local estate agent will also be invited to give their opinion on the property. The auction will then be shown and the final sale price revealed.
It is at this point we first meet the new buyer, and Martin or Lucy will interview them and find out their background, why they bought the property, whether they are happy with it given</desc>

According to Jim is an American sitcom television series starring Jim Belushi in the title role as a suburban father of three children. It originally ran on ABC from October 3, 2001 to June 2, 2009.
Jim is an abrasive but lovable suburban father. Much like his real life counterpart, Jim's character is noted as a fan of blues music, as well as the Chicago Bears, Chicago Cubs, Chicago Bulls and the Chicago Blackhawks. Together with his wife Cheryl, whose middle name is Mabel, they have three children, daughters Ruby and Gracie and son Kyle. In the seventh season they become parents of a pair of twins Jonathan and Gordon.
Jim often finds himself in messy situations because his laziness inclines him to search for alternative ways of doing things with least effort. While Cheryl's brother Andy may be Jim's best friend, her sister Dana frequently teams up with Cheryl against Jim. He also prefers to lie to Cheryl and Dana to do his own activities but they end up backfiring on him. He hates losing to women (e.g. Hot Dog Eating Contests, Hamburger Eating Contests, Pizza Eating Contests, Pot Pie Eating Contests), especially if Cheryl or Dana find out.

The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series is a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle epitomized by its family of the same name, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture, society, television and many aspects of the human condition.
The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox, becoming the network's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989–1990).
Since its debut on December 17, 1989, the show has broadcast 508 episodes and the twenty-third season started airing on September 25, 2011. The Simpsons is the longest-running American sitcom, the longest-running American animated program, and in</desc>

Hollyoaks is a long-running British television soap opera, first broadcast on Channel 4 on 23 October 1995. It was originally devised by Phil Redmond, who has also devised shows including Brookside and Grange Hill. The programme is set in a fictional suburb of Chester called Hollyoaks and is centred around a local further education college called Hollyoaks Community College, with the characters generally being in their late teens or early twenties. Since 1995, the cast has expanded from just seven major characters to approximately 50 cast members. Since the long-serving producer Bryan Kirkwood quit in 2009, the role of series producer has seen several changes. Kirkwood's successor Lucy Allan stepped down from her position in 2010 after just twelve months, and her replacement, former The Bill producer Paul Marquess took control later that year. Like his predecessor, Marquess left the series after a year and Gareth Philips was appointed as series producer. Emma Smithwick later replaced Phillips as a permanent replacement. Smithwick was a series editor of the soap for a while, before taking on the role of producer in Autumn 2011.

Supersize vs Superskinny is a British television programme on Channel 4 that features information about dieting and extreme eating lifestyles. One of the main show features is a weekly comparison between an overweight person, and an underweight person.

Also, she discovered Diabulimia and spoke to Isabelle Caro, a French actress, renowned for her underweight figure and anorexia campaign.
During the first series in 2008, one feature involved Gillian McKeith, who tried to find a way to "ban big bums" in the UK. She tested out different exercises to tone bums on different groups of ladies, and made a leader board for the most effective.

8 out of 10 Cats is a British television comedy panel game made by Zeppotron (a subsidiary of Endemol) for Channel 4. It was first broadcast on 3 June 2005. The show is based on statistics and opinion polls, and draws on polls produced by a variety of organizations and new polls commissioned for the programme, carried out by company Harris Poll. The show's title is derived from a well-known advertising tagline for Whiskas cat food which originally claimed that "8 out of 10 cats prefer Whiskas". The first advert ever screened during the show's commercial break was for Whiskas.
The show is hosted by comedian Jimmy Carr and features two teams, consisting of a regular team captain and two celebrity guests each.

Fireman Sam (Welsh: Sam Tân) is a Welsh animated children's television series about a fireman called Sam, his fellow firefighters, and other townspeople in the fictional Welsh town of Pontypandy (a portmanteau of two real towns, Pontypridd and Tonypandy, which are situated approximately 5 miles (8.0 km) apart in the South Wales valleys). The original idea for the show came from two ex-firemen from the English county of Kent. They took their idea to artist_writer Rob Lee who developed the concept for them. The finished concept was then presented to S4C who saw the potential in the series and commissioned it.
Fireman Sam first appeared in Welsh on S4C in 1985 and later in English throughout the United Kingdom on BBC1 in 1987. The series finished in 1994 but remains popular well over a decade after the last episode was aired. The series was also shown in Gaelic in Scotland, where it was known as Sam Smalaidh. The series has been sold to over 40 countries, from Australia to Norway and is used across the United Kingdom to promote fire safety.
In 1996, a stage production was turned into a feature, Fireman Sam In Action and released on BBC Video.

Bananas in Pyjamas is an Australian children's television show that premiered on 20 July 1992 on ABC. It has since become syndicated in many different countries, and dubbed into other languages. In the United States, the "Pyjamas" in the title was modified to reflect the American spelling pajamas. This aired in syndication from 1995 to 1997 as a half-hour series, then became a 15-minute show paired with a short-lived 15-minute series The Crayon Box, under a 30-minute block produced by Sachs Family Entertainment titled Bananas in Pajamas &amp; The Crayon Box. Additionally, the characters and a scene from the show were featured in the Kids for Character sequel titled Kids for Character: Choices Count. The pilot episode was Pink Mug.
The concept was inspired by the success of the song Bananas in Pyjamas, written by Carey Blyton in 1967, on Play School. This song, which had become a regular item on Play School, became the theme of the new series.
The series was revamped in May 2011, now as a CGI series created by Southern Star Entertainment.
The main characters are two humanoid bananas named B1 and B2. Other characters include three teddy bears named Amy, Lulu and Morgan, and Rat in a Hat.</desc>

Neighbours is an Australian television soap opera. It was first broadcast on the Seven Network on 18 March 1985. It was created by TV executive Reg Watson, who proposed the idea of making a show that focused on realistic stories and portrayed adults and teenagers who talk openly and solve their problems together. Seven decided to commission the show following the success of Watson's Sons and Daughters, which aired on the network. Although successful in Melbourne, Neighbours underperformed in the Sydney market and struggled for months before Seven cancelled it. The show was immediately bought by rival network Ten. After taking over production of the show, the new network had to build replica sets because Seven destroyed the originals to prevent its rival from obtaining them. Ten began screening Neighbours on 20 January 1986, taking off where the previous series left off and commencing with episode 171. Neighbours has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and in 2005, it was inducted collectively into the Logie Hall of Fame.

NCIS, formerly known as NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service, is an American police procedural drama television series revolving around a fictional team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which conducts criminal investigations involving the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.
The concept and characters were initially introduced in a two-part episode of the CBS series JAG (JAG episodes 8.20 and 8.21). The show, a spin-off from JAG, premiered on September 23, 2003 on CBS and, to date, has aired nine full seasons and has gone into syndicated reruns on USA Network, Cloo (formerly Sleuth), and Ion Television. Donald Bellisario, who created JAG as well as the well-known series Airwolf, Magnum, P.I., and Quantum Leap, is co-creator and executive producer of NCIS.
NCIS was originally referred to as Navy NCIS during season one; however, the word "Navy" was later dropped from the title as it was redundant. In season seven, NCIS was joined by a spin-off series, NCIS: Los Angeles, starring Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J.
In 2011, NCIS was voted as America’s favorite television show. On March 14, 2012, CBS renewed NCIS for a 10th season.

House Doctor is a television programme, originally broadcast on Channel 5 in the UK. Each week, the House Doctor, Californian real estate stylist Ann Maurice helps UK home owners sell their houses with her industry know-how and style tips. The popularity of the show has let the word "house doctoring" to British English lexicon, to the American term home staging. This program is now shown in many countries around the globe which is broadening the use and familiarity of this term.
Developed by Talkback Productions, the 30-minute show opens with a presenter (a male to off-set Maurice), who shows to the present owners a video recording of the reactions of a number of prospective purchasers viewing the house, and their (negative) feedback.

Wildlife SOS is a TV show on Animal Planet, based in the UK's Wildlife Aid in Leatherhead, Surrey. The show has been running since 1996 and produced by Simon Cowell's Wild Productions. And can be found on Animal Planet, Channel 5 and DMAX (relative to May 2009). It is run almost completely by volunteers. Whilst Simon (founder of the charity) is often wandering around the British country side, rescuing injured, sick or orphaned wildlife, other volunteers are usually at the hospital treating and raising patients, so they can be ready to be released back into the wild.
In 1996, following a fire that destroyed one third of the hospital complex, Cowell found his organisation reliant on media attention for its continued survival. Cowell was approached by representatives of the newly formed Animal Planet channel to produce a television series chronicling the drama of life in the wildlife rescue facility. The show experienced long-term success; it has been cited as "the longest-running animal rescue TV series" and continues to broadcast on Animal Planet, and various other channels owned by Discovery Communications. The centre is run by donations from the public. And has an annual open day</desc>

Alan Carr: Chatty Man (also simply known as Chatty Man) is an award-winning British comedy chat show presented by comedian Alan Carr. The show features interviews with celebrity guests, sketches, topical chat and music.
The show was first on as a pilot in late May 2009, the show proved popular with the public and was commissioned for a series. The first episode drew in a total of 2.15 million viewers. To date, the show has rebroadcast 7 series and 55 episodes. Carr has signed a new deal worth £4 million, which will keep the show on air to 2014, spanning another four more series.
A structural difference from other British chat shows is that while the guests for each episode of Chatty Man all tape on the same day, there is no on screen interaction between the guests. A guest will be introduced and be interviewed, and then they are gone when the next guest comes out. An advantage to this taping process is the fact that Carr is able to pretape interviews with certain guests. If a particular guest is unavailable to be interviewed on the chosen week, an interview can be pre-taped and slotted in during the next week's editing. Often, at the end of a series, the final episode can be made</desc>

Location, Location, Location is a Channel 4 property programme, presented by Kirstie Allsopp and Phil Spencer and produced by IWC Media, part of the RDF Media Group. The reality show follows Kirstie and Phil as they try to find the perfect home for a different set of buyers each week. It first aired in May 2000.
The 2007 series had a major revamp. The opening titles logo was changed and the format of the show altered. Instead of only one couple per week looking for a house in a town, two couples with different tastes look for a house in the same city with the presenters going back and forth to the different househunters. Each episode was extended to 60 minutes from the original 30. The first episode featured Glasgow and the second Sheffield.
A traditional turn of phrase used by property experts is that the three most important factors in determining the desirability of a property are "location, location, location". The phrase has been said to have been coined by Harold Samuel, though it appears in print as early as 1926.

Homes Under the Hammer is a BBC One morning television series, which has been running since 2003. Its main presenters are Lucy Alexander and Martin Roberts, although in series three Marc Woodward and Jasmine Birtles alternated presenting duties with Alexander and Roberts. The series is the BBC's most successful show that has been shown in the 10.00am slot, regularly attaining a 30% share for new episodes.
Each episode of the show follows three properties (or two for 30-minute shows) which were bought at auction - often ones that require significant refurbishment. A cross-section of properties are featured including terraced, commercial, rural, and vacant land. The programme follows a set formula. One of the presenters will view the property prior to going up for auction giving their opinion on it and its potential problems as well as attractive features. A local estate agent will also be invited to give their opinion on the property. The auction will then be shown and the final sale price revealed.
It is at this point we first meet the new buyer, and Martin or Lucy will interview them and find out their background, why they bought the property, whether they are happy with it given</desc>

Doctors is a British daytime television soap opera, set in the fictional Midland town of Letherbridge, defined as being close to the city of Birmingham, following the staff and their families of a doctor's surgery.
Doctors is produced by BBC Birmingham and is screened on BBC One, with the first episode broadcast on 26 March 2000. It was created by Chris Murray, with Mal Young developing it and Carson Black the original producer. The show has been shown at lunchtime since its inception, originally at 12.30pm as a lead-in to the BBC's One O'Clock News. After it was temporarily moved to allow for extended news coverage of the September 11th 2001 attacks, its regular slot changed to 2:10 pm, following directly after Neighbours, after ratings rose to a 25% audience share. When the BBC lost Neighbours to Channel 5 in January 2008, it moved into the Australian soap's old slot of 1:45pm. For a brief trial period in Summer 2000, selected episodes from the first series were shown on Fridays at 7 pm and from 16 February 2009, the show began transmitting in high definition on BBC HD at 4:00pm the same day.

Perfection is a game show shown on BBC Two, hosted by Nick Knowles. It was first broadcast on 17 January 2011.
Four players, referred to by the host as the "Usual Suspects", compete. One contestant is chosen at random from the four to compete in the main game on stage, while the other three play against the contestant from their soundproof booth. In each of the three initial rounds of the game, the host starts by turning off the booth, so the Usual Suspects can neither hear nor see anything happening on stage. The contestant is then given four true-or-false statements to answer in 45 seconds. Once all four answers have been locked in, the booth is turned back on so the Usual Suspects can see the contestant's answers.
The host then reveals how many answers the contestant got right, but not which specific ones. If all four are correct, the contestant wins the round immediately. If the contestant got less than four correct, the Usual Suspects have the chance to change the contestant's answers, with the knowledge of how many he_she got wrong. Should the Usual Suspects correctly change the contestant's answers, they win the round. If they get one wrong though, neither contestant nor</desc>

Pointless is a quiz show shown on BBC One, hosted by Alexander Armstrong, with Richard Osman as an assistant. It has been broadcast since 24 August 2009.
Similar to Family Fortunes, contestants must give answers to a question which had previously been asked to one hundred members of the public. However, there are important differences:
The object of the game is to score as few points as possible by giving correct answers that the public have or have not given, ultimately scoring lower than other contestants. The contestants particularly try to look for answers that score no points, which are known as "Pointless" answers. Finding a Pointless Answer adds £250 to the jackpot in rounds prior to the Final, and finding a Pointless Answer in the Final wins the game.
At the beginning of the show there are four teams (five in the first series) of two players. Any team which does not reach the final of the show on their first appearance is invited back for a second (and final) appearance on the next show.
The aim of the show is to get as few points as possible, by answering questions with lesser known correct answers.

The series was created by Tony McHale and Mal Young as a spin-off from the established BBC medical drama Casualty, and premiered on 12 January 1999. It is set in the same hospital as Casualty, Holby General, in the fictional city of Holby, and features occasional crossovers of characters and plots with both Casualty (in episodes broadcast as Casualty@Holby City) and the show's 2007 police procedural spin-off HolbyBlue. Its first executive producers were Mal and Johnathan Young, who were succeeded by Kathleen Hutchison from 2003 to 2004, Richard Stokes from 2004 to 2006, McHale from 2006 to 2010 and Belinda Campbell from 2010.
The show follows the lives of medical and ancillary staff at the fictional Holby City Hospital. It began with eleven main characters in its first series, all of whom have since left the show. New main characters have been both written in and out of the series since, with a core of fifteen main actors employed on the serial at any given time.

Homes Under the Hammer is a BBC One morning television series, which has been running since 2003. Its main presenters are Lucy Alexander and Martin Roberts, although in series three Marc Woodward and Jasmine Birtles alternated presenting duties with Alexander and Roberts. The series is the BBC's most successful show that has been shown in the 10.00am slot, regularly attaining a 30% share for new episodes.
Each episode of the show follows three properties (or two for 30-minute shows) which were bought at auction - often ones that require significant refurbishment. A cross-section of properties are featured including terraced, commercial, rural, and vacant land. The programme follows a set formula. One of the presenters will view the property prior to going up for auction giving their opinion on it and its potential problems as well as attractive features. A local estate agent will also be invited to give their opinion on the property. The auction will then be shown and the final sale price revealed.
It is at this point we first meet the new buyer, and Martin or Lucy will interview them and find out their background, why they bought the property, whether they are happy with it given</desc>

Doctors is produced by BBC Birmingham and is screened on BBC One, with the first episode broadcast on 26 March 2000. It was created by Chris Murray, with Mal Young developing it and Carson Black the original producer. The show has been shown at lunchtime since its inception, originally at 12.30pm as a lead-in to the BBC's One O'Clock News. After it was temporarily moved to allow for extended news coverage of the September 11th 2001 attacks, its regular slot changed to 2:10 pm, following directly after Neighbours, after ratings rose to a 25% audience share. When the BBC lost Neighbours to Channel 5 in January 2008, it moved into the Australian soap's old slot of 1:45pm. For a brief trial period in Summer 2000, selected episodes from the first series were shown on Fridays at 7 pm and from 16 February 2009, the show began transmitting in high definition on BBC HD at 4:00pm the same day.

Perfection is a game show shown on BBC Two, hosted by Nick Knowles. It was first broadcast on 17 January 2011.
Four players, referred to by the host as the "Usual Suspects", compete. One contestant is chosen at random from the four to compete in the main game on stage, while the other three play against the contestant from their soundproof booth. In each of the three initial rounds of the game, the host starts by turning off the booth, so the Usual Suspects can neither hear nor see anything happening on stage. The contestant is then given four true-or-false statements to answer in 45 seconds. Once all four answers have been locked in, the booth is turned back on so the Usual Suspects can see the contestant's answers.
The host then reveals how many answers the contestant got right, but not which specific ones. If all four are correct, the contestant wins the round immediately. If the contestant got less than four correct, the Usual Suspects have the chance to change the contestant's answers, with the knowledge of how many he_she got wrong. Should the Usual Suspects correctly change the contestant's answers, they win the round. If they get one wrong though, neither contestant nor</desc>

Similar to Family Fortunes, contestants must give answers to a question which had previously been asked to one hundred members of the public. However, there are important differences:
The object of the game is to score as few points as possible by giving correct answers that the public have or have not given, ultimately scoring lower than other contestants. The contestants particularly try to look for answers that score no points, which are known as "Pointless" answers. Finding a Pointless Answer adds £250 to the jackpot in rounds prior to the Final, and finding a Pointless Answer in the Final wins the game.
At the beginning of the show there are four teams (five in the first series) of two players. Any team which does not reach the final of the show on their first appearance is invited back for a second (and final) appearance on the next show.
The aim of the show is to get as few points as possible, by answering questions with lesser known correct answers.

The show follows the lives of medical and ancillary staff at the fictional Holby City Hospital. It began with eleven main characters in its first series, all of whom have since left the show. New main characters have been both written in and out of the series since, with a core of fifteen main actors employed on the serial at any given time.

The series is the BBC's most successful show that has been shown in the 10.00am slot, regularly attaining a 30% share for new episodes.
Each episode of the show follows three properties (or two for 30-minute shows) which were bought at auction - often ones that require significant refurbishment. A cross-section of properties are featured including terraced, commercial, rural, and vacant land. The programme follows a set formula. One of the presenters will view the property prior to going up for auction giving their opinion on it and its potential problems as well as attractive features. A local estate agent will also be invited to give their opinion on the property. The auction will then be shown and the final sale price revealed.
It is at this point we first meet the new buyer, and Martin or Lucy will interview them and find out their background, why they bought the property, whether they are happy with it given</desc>

Doctors is a British daytime television soap opera, set in the fictional Midland town of Letherbridge, defined as being close to the city of Birmingham, following the staff and their families of a doctor's surgery.
Doctors is produced by BBC Birmingham and is screened on BBC One, with the first episode broadcast on 26 March 2000. It was created by Chris Murray, with Mal Young developing it and Carson Black the original producer. The show has been shown at lunchtime since its inception, originally at 12.30pm as a lead-in to the BBC's One O'Clock News. After it was temporarily moved to allow for extended news coverage of the September 11th 2001 attacks, its regular slot changed to 2:10 pm, following directly after Neighbours, after ratings rose to a 25% audience share. When the BBC lost Neighbours to Channel 5 in January 2008, it moved into the Australian soap's old slot of 1:45pm. For a brief trial period in Summer 2000, selected episodes from the first series were shown on Fridays at 7 pm and from 16 February 2009, the show began transmitting in high definition on BBC HD at 4:00pm the same day.

Perfection is a game show shown on BBC Two, hosted by Nick Knowles. It was first broadcast on 17 January 2011.
Four players, referred to by the host as the "Usual Suspects", compete. One contestant is chosen at random from the four to compete in the main game on stage, while the other three play against the contestant from their soundproof booth. In each of the three initial rounds of the game, the host starts by turning off the booth, so the Usual Suspects can neither hear nor see anything happening on stage. The contestant is then given four true-or-false statements to answer in 45 seconds. Once all four answers have been locked in, the booth is turned back on so the Usual Suspects can see the contestant's answers.
The host then reveals how many answers the contestant got right, but not which specific ones. If all four are correct, the contestant wins the round immediately. If the contestant got less than four correct, the Usual Suspects have the chance to change the contestant's answers, with the knowledge of how many he_she got wrong. Should the Usual Suspects correctly change the contestant's answers, they win the round. If they get one wrong though, neither contestant nor</desc>

Pointless is a quiz show shown on BBC One, hosted by Alexander Armstrong, with Richard Osman as an assistant. It has been broadcast since 24 August 2009.
Similar to Family Fortunes, contestants must give answers to a question which had previously been asked to one hundred members of the public. However, there are important differences:
The object of the game is to score as few points as possible by giving correct answers that the public have or have not given, ultimately scoring lower than other contestants. The contestants particularly try to look for answers that score no points, which are known as "Pointless" answers. Finding a Pointless Answer adds £250 to the jackpot in rounds prior to the Final, and finding a Pointless Answer in the Final wins the game.
At the beginning of the show there are four teams (five in the first series) of two players. Any team which does not reach the final of the show on their first appearance is invited back for a second (and final) appearance on the next show.
The aim of the show is to get as few points as possible, by answering questions with lesser known correct answers.

The show follows the lives of medical and ancillary staff at the fictional Holby City Hospital. It began with eleven main characters in its first series, all of whom have since left the show. New main characters have been both written in and out of the series since, with a core of fifteen main actors employed on the serial at any given time. In casting the first series, Young sought out actors who were already well known in the television industry,</desc>

Homes Under the Hammer is a BBC One morning television series, which has been running since 2003. Its main presenters are Lucy Alexander and Martin Roberts, although in series three Marc Woodward and Jasmine Birtles alternated presenting duties with Alexander and Roberts. The series is the BBC's most successful show that has been shown in the 10.00am slot, regularly attaining a 30% share for new episodes.
Each episode of the show follows three properties (or two for 30-minute shows) which were bought at auction - often ones that require significant refurbishment. A cross-section of properties are featured including terraced, commercial, rural, and vacant land. The programme follows a set formula. One of the presenters will view the property prior to going up for auction giving their opinion on it and its potential problems as well as attractive features. A local estate agent will also be invited to give their opinion on the property. The auction will then be shown and the final sale price revealed.

The programme can be watched in any part of the UK (and Europe) on digital satellite channel 972 on the BBC UK regional TV on satellite service. Selected video packages from the programme are available on the BBC news website.
The programme began at 6:10pm on Monday 17 September 1962. Its predecessor, a short News from Wales bulletin, started in 1957 and was originally presented by Michael Aspel. The new programme, originally presented by Brian Hoey, shared a 25-minute timeslot for regional news with Points West from Bristol - at the time, both programmes were broadcast to Wales and the West of England from the Wenvoe transmitter near Cardiff.
By February 1964, two new television regions, BBC Wales and BBC West, had been created with the addition of a new channel (13) for Wales on Wenvoe.

Doctors is a British daytime television soap opera, set in the fictional Midland town of Letherbridge, defined as being close to the city of Birmingham, following the staff and their families of a doctor's surgery.
Doctors is produced by BBC Birmingham and is screened on BBC One, with the first episode broadcast on 26 March 2000. It was created by Chris Murray, with Mal Young developing it and Carson Black the original producer. The show has been shown at lunchtime since its inception, originally at 12.30pm as a lead-in to the BBC's One O'Clock News. After it was temporarily moved to allow for extended news coverage of the September 11th 2001 attacks, its regular slot changed to 2:10 pm, following directly after Neighbours, after ratings rose to a 25% audience share. When the BBC lost Neighbours to Channel 5 in January 2008, it moved into the Australian soap's old slot of 1:45pm. For a brief trial period in Summer 2000, selected episodes from the first series were shown on Fridays at 7 pm and from 16 February 2009, the show began transmitting in high definition on BBC HD at 4:00pm the same day.

Perfection is a game show shown on BBC Two, hosted by Nick Knowles. It was first broadcast on 17 January 2011.
Four players, referred to by the host as the "Usual Suspects", compete. One contestant is chosen at random from the four to compete in the main game on stage, while the other three play against the contestant from their soundproof booth. In each of the three initial rounds of the game, the host starts by turning off the booth, so the Usual Suspects can neither hear nor see anything happening on stage. The contestant is then given four true-or-false statements to answer in 45 seconds. Once all four answers have been locked in, the booth is turned back on so the Usual Suspects can see the contestant's answers.
The host then reveals how many answers the contestant got right, but not which specific ones. If all four are correct, the contestant wins the round immediately. If the contestant got less than four correct, the Usual Suspects have the chance to change the contestant's answers, with the knowledge of how many he_she got wrong. Should the Usual Suspects correctly change the contestant's answers, they win the round. If they get one wrong though, neither contestant nor</desc>

Similar to Family Fortunes, contestants must give answers to a question which had previously been asked to one hundred members of the public. However, there are important differences:
The object of the game is to score as few points as possible by giving correct answers that the public have or have not given, ultimately scoring lower than other contestants. The contestants particularly try to look for answers that score no points, which are known as "Pointless" answers. Finding a Pointless Answer adds £250 to the jackpot in rounds prior to the Final, and finding a Pointless Answer in the Final wins the game.
At the beginning of the show there are four teams (five in the first series) of two players. Any team which does not reach the final of the show on their first appearance is invited back for a second (and final) appearance on the next show.
The aim of the show is to get as few points as possible, by answering questions with lesser known correct answers.

Wales Today thus became a 25-minute programme broadcast only to Wales while Points West was only broadcast to the West of England. In 1969, separate UHF transmitters at Wenvoe (Wales) and Mendip (West) meant complete separation, except for overlap areas in</desc>

Freebase:
Don't Get Done, Get Dom is a British reality television series which helps consumers get good deals when purchasing goods. The show lends its name from its presenter Dominic Littlewood. It is aired on BBC One and repeated on BBC Two in the UK.
Series one was first aired in June 2006 and a second series was later commissioned and began to air in June 2007. Series three began in June 2008. Series four aired for two weeks on BBC in late May to early June 2010. Series five began on 25 April 2011. Series six was shown from 9–27 April 2012.
During the show, a member of the public is "tutored" into getting a better deal on a product which they are attempting to buy; typically giving them more confidence in talking to and making deals with the store assistants and managers. Examples from the series are people purchasing video cameras and sports gear.
This is achieved by Littlewood seeing camera footage of a first attempt, and giving them pointers. After this they try another shop but this time Littlewood can communicate to the member of the public by means of a hidden earpiece.

Hardtalk (styled as HARDtalk) is a flagship BBC television programme, consisting of in-depth half-hour one-on-one interviews.
It is broadcast four days a week (Monday to Thursday) on BBC World News and the BBC News channel. Launched in 1997, much of its worldwide fame is due to its global reach via BBC World. Until early 2005, the host was Tim Sebastian, whose famous, and sometimes controversial, style of tough questioning brought a huge world audience to the show. It is normally broadcast late at night on the BBC News Channel. Until the mid-zeros, it was broadcast at around 11: 30 p.m., but in more recent times, it has been broaadcast later, at around half past twelve in the morning.
Since 2006, the show has been presented by Stephen Sackur, who was previously the BBC's correspondent in Washington and Brussels and who is an experienced interviewer who has grilled U.S. Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. He is occasionally replaced by several other well-known BBC presenters such as Zeinab Badawi, Carrie Gracie and Sarah Montague. Other occasional presenters have included Jon Sopel, David Jessel, Lyse Doucet, Nisha Pillai, Noel Thompson and Katya Adler.

Eggheads is a BBC quiz show created by 12 Yard Productions, first broadcast in 2003, and co-presented by Dermot Murnaghan and Jeremy Vine. For the 2008 series, Jeremy Vine was brought in to present on nights when Murnaghan was hosting the spinoff series Are You an Egghead? This happened again from October 2009 while Murnaghan presented the second series of the spinoff show. Since the spin-off show finished, Jeremy Vine has continued to host the second half of each series, which broadcasts 52 weeks a year. The show pits a team of five 'Eggheads' (made up from seven highly regarded quiz and game show champions, rotating each episode) against a series of teams of five 'challengers' who in each episode attempt to beat the Eggheads through a series of rounds. It is normally shown weekdays every week.
The title sequence consists of a voiceover by the host stating 'These people are amongst the greatest quiz players in Britain. Together they make up the Eggheads, arguably the most formidable quiz team in the country. The question is: can they be beaten?'

Great British Railway Journeys is a BBC travel documentary television series presented by Michael Portillo. The first series premiered on 4 January 2010 on BBC Two, running for 20 half-hour episodes; two further seasons followed in 2011 and in 2012, but with each season extended from 20 to 25 episodes; a fourth season is being filmed for release in early 2013. In the series, Portillo travels around the British railway network, guided by a Victorian guidebook written by George Bradshaw, and compares how the destinations have changed in Victorian and modern times.
Travelling around Great Britain by train, Portillo uses a copy of Victorian cartographer George Bradshaw's Railway Companion to compare and contrast modern Britain with that documented by Bradshaw in the 1840s, visiting recommended points of interest which would have been of interest to the Victorians. George Bradshaw was a cartographer who in 1840 became the first person to produce a comprehensive timetable and travel guide of the railway system in Great Britain, which at the time although extensive, still comprised a series of fragmented and competing railway companies and lines each publishing their own literature.

Newsnight is a BBC Television current affairs programme noted for its in-depth analysis and often robust cross-examination of senior politicians. Jeremy Paxman has been its main presenter for over two decades.
Several of the programme's editors over the years have gone on to senior positions within the BBC and elsewhere. Paxman's fellow presenters are Gavin Esler, Kirsty Wark and Emily Maitlis. Newsnight has been broadcast on BBC Two since 1980. It goes out on weekday evenings between 10:30pm and 11:20pm. Occasionally it may have an extended edition if there is an especially eventful event in the news - as happened on July 7 2011, when closure of the News of the World led to an extended version which went on until 11:35 pm. Recordings are available within the UK via the BBC website. A weekly 26-minute digest edition of Newsnight is screened on the corporation's international channel, BBC World News.
Newsnight in its current format began on 30 January 1980, although a shorter news bulletin of the same name had run in its late-night BBC2 slot during the 1970s. Its launch was delayed for four months by the Association of Broadcasting Staff, at the time the main BBC trade union.</desc>

A local estate agent will also be invited to give their opinion on the property. The auction will then be shown and the final sale price revealed.

Hardtalk (styled as HARDtalk) is a flagship BBC television programme, consisting of in-depth half-hour one-on-one interviews.
It is broadcast four days a week (Monday to Thursday) on BBC World News and the BBC News channel. Launched in 1997, much of its worldwide fame is due to its global reach via BBC World. Until early 2005, the host was Tim Sebastian, whose famous, and sometimes controversial, style of tough questioning brought a huge world audience to the show. It is normally broadcast late at night on the BBC News Channel. Until the mid-zeros, it was broadcast at around 11: 30 p.m., but in more recent times, it has been broaadcast later, at around half past twelve in the morning.
Since 2006, the show has been presented by Stephen Sackur, who was previously the BBC's correspondent in Washington and Brussels and who is an experienced interviewer who has grilled U.S. Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. He is occasionally replaced by several other well-known BBC presenters such as Zeinab Badawi, Carrie Gracie and Sarah Montague. Other occasional presenters have included Jon Sopel, David Jessel, Lyse Doucet, Nisha Pillai, Noel Thompson and Katya Adler.

Eggheads is a BBC quiz show created by 12 Yard Productions, first broadcast in 2003, and co-presented by Dermot Murnaghan and Jeremy Vine. For the 2008 series, Jeremy Vine was brought in to present on nights when Murnaghan was hosting the spinoff series Are You an Egghead? This happened again from October 2009 while Murnaghan presented the second series of the spinoff show. Since the spin-off show finished, Jeremy Vine has continued to host the second half of each series, which broadcasts 52 weeks a year. The show pits a team of five 'Eggheads' (made up from seven highly regarded quiz and game show champions, rotating each episode) against a series of teams of five 'challengers' who in each episode attempt to beat the Eggheads through a series of rounds. It is normally shown weekdays every week.
The title sequence consists of a voiceover by the host stating 'These people are amongst the greatest quiz players in Britain. Together they make up the Eggheads, arguably the most formidable quiz team in the country. The question is: can they be beaten?'

Great British Railway Journeys is a BBC travel documentary television series presented by Michael Portillo. The first series premiered on 4 January 2010 on BBC Two, running for 20 half-hour episodes; two further seasons followed in 2011 and in 2012, but with each season extended from 20 to 25 episodes; a fourth season is being filmed for release in early 2013. In the series, Portillo travels around the British railway network, guided by a Victorian guidebook written by George Bradshaw, and compares how the destinations have changed in Victorian and modern times.
Travelling around Great Britain by train, Portillo uses a copy of Victorian cartographer George Bradshaw's Railway Companion to compare and contrast modern Britain with that documented by Bradshaw in the 1840s, visiting recommended points of interest which would have been of interest to the Victorians. George Bradshaw was a cartographer who in 1840 became the first person to produce a comprehensive timetable and travel guide of the railway system in Great Britain, which at the time although extensive, still comprised a series of fragmented and competing railway companies and lines each publishing their own literature.

Newsnight is a BBC Television current affairs programme noted for its in-depth analysis and often robust cross-examination of senior politicians. Jeremy Paxman has been its main presenter for over two decades.
Several of the programme's editors over the years have gone on to senior positions within the BBC and elsewhere. Paxman's fellow presenters are Gavin Esler, Kirsty Wark and Emily Maitlis. Newsnight has been broadcast on BBC Two since 1980. It goes out on weekday evenings between 10:30pm and 11:20pm. Occasionally it may have an extended edition if there is an especially eventful event in the news - as happened on July 7 2011, when closure of the News of the World led to an extended version which went on until 11:35 pm. Recordings are available within the UK via the BBC website. A weekly 26-minute digest edition of Newsnight is screened on the corporation's international channel, BBC World News.
Newsnight in its current format began on 30 January 1980, although a shorter news bulletin of the same name had run in its late-night BBC2 slot during the 1970s. Its launch was delayed for four months by the Association of Broadcasting Staff, at the time the main BBC trade union.</desc>

Newsnight Scotland is a BBC Scotland television news programme which started on Monday 4 October 1999. The programme is aired from BBC Pacific Quay in Glasgow, and is an opt out of the main London-based Newsnight programme. It is on at 11pm from Mondays to Thursdays, replacing the last twenty minutes of Newsnight on BBC Two Scotland (available from the Astra 2D satellite outside Scotland).
Newsnight Scotland covers all topical and political issues that affect Scotland. Often the issues derive from the goings-on at the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood. The programme has investigated many topics, including the costs of the construction of the Holyrood site. It reported in great detail about the decisions leading to this, including the competition for Scotland's new parliament. The biggest story covered so far was the parliament itself; with extensive coverage of the Fraser Inquiry.
Newsnight Scotland came about as a result of calls for a Scottish-based version of the BBC News at Six (the so-called "Scottish Six") following the vote in favour of Scottish devolution. As this did not come about a 'compromise' was then reached in 1999, when Newsnight Scotland was devised.

Hardtalk (styled as HARDtalk) is a flagship BBC television programme, consisting of in-depth half-hour one-on-one interviews.
It is broadcast four days a week (Monday to Thursday) on BBC World News and the BBC News channel. Launched in 1997, much of its worldwide fame is due to its global reach via BBC World. Until early 2005, the host was Tim Sebastian, whose famous, and sometimes controversial, style of tough questioning brought a huge world audience to the show. It is normally broadcast late at night on the BBC News Channel. Until the mid-zeros, it was broadcast at around 11: 30 p.m., but in more recent times, it has been broaadcast later, at around half past twelve in the morning.
Since 2006, the show has been presented by Stephen Sackur, who was previously the BBC's correspondent in Washington and Brussels and who is an experienced interviewer who has grilled U.S. Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. He is occasionally replaced by several other well-known BBC presenters such as Zeinab Badawi, Carrie Gracie and Sarah Montague. Other occasional presenters have included Jon Sopel, David Jessel, Lyse Doucet, Nisha Pillai, Noel Thompson and Katya Adler.

Eggheads is a BBC quiz show created by 12 Yard Productions, first broadcast in 2003, and co-presented by Dermot Murnaghan and Jeremy Vine. For the 2008 series, Jeremy Vine was brought in to present on nights when Murnaghan was hosting the spinoff series Are You an Egghead? This happened again from October 2009 while Murnaghan presented the second series of the spinoff show. Since the spin-off show finished, Jeremy Vine has continued to host the second half of each series, which broadcasts 52 weeks a year. The show pits a team of five 'Eggheads' (made up from seven highly regarded quiz and game show champions, rotating each episode) against a series of teams of five 'challengers' who in each episode attempt to beat the Eggheads through a series of rounds. It is normally shown weekdays every week.
The title sequence consists of a voiceover by the host stating 'These people are amongst the greatest quiz players in Britain. Together they make up the Eggheads, arguably the most formidable quiz team in the country. The question is: can they be beaten?'

Freebase:
Great British Railway Journeys is a BBC travel documentary television series presented by Michael Portillo. The first series premiered on 4 January 2010 on BBC Two, running for 20 half-hour episodes; two further seasons followed in 2011 and in 2012, but with each season extended from 20 to 25 episodes; a fourth season is being filmed for release in early 2013. In the series, Portillo travels around the British railway network, guided by a Victorian guidebook written by George Bradshaw, and compares how the destinations have changed in Victorian and modern times.
Travelling around Great Britain by train, Portillo uses a copy of Victorian cartographer George Bradshaw's Railway Companion to compare and contrast modern Britain with that documented by Bradshaw in the 1840s, visiting recommended points of interest which would have been of interest to the Victorians. George Bradshaw was a cartographer who in 1840 became the first person to produce a comprehensive timetable and travel guide of the railway system in Great Britain, which at the time although extensive, still comprised a series of fragmented and competing railway companies and lines each publishing their own literature.

Newsnight is a BBC Television current affairs programme noted for its in-depth analysis and often robust cross-examination of senior politicians. Jeremy Paxman has been its main presenter for over two decades.
Several of the programme's editors over the years have gone on to senior positions within the BBC and elsewhere. Paxman's fellow presenters are Gavin Esler, Kirsty Wark and Emily Maitlis. Newsnight has been broadcast on BBC Two since 1980. It goes out on weekday evenings between 10:30pm and 11:20pm. Occasionally it may have an extended edition if there is an especially eventful event in the news - as happened on July 7 2011, when closure of the News of the World led to an extended version which went on until 11:35 pm. Recordings are available within the UK via the BBC website. A weekly 26-minute digest edition of Newsnight is screened on the corporation's international channel, BBC World News.
Newsnight in its current format began on 30 January 1980, although a shorter news bulletin of the same name had run in its late-night BBC2 slot during the 1970s. Its launch was delayed for four months by the Association of Broadcasting Staff, at the time the main BBC trade union.</desc>

Homes Under the Hammer is a BBC One morning television series, which has been running since 2003. Its main presenters are Lucy Alexander and Martin Roberts, although in series three Marc Woodward and Jasmine Birtles alternated presenting duties with Alexander and Roberts. The series is the BBC's most successful show that has been shown in the 10.00am slot, regularly attaining a 30% share for new episodes.
Each episode of the show follows three properties (or two for 30-minute shows) which were bought at auction - often ones that require significant refurbishment. A cross-section of properties are featured including terraced, commercial, rural, and vacant land. The programme follows a set formula. One of the presenters will view the property prior to going up for auction giving their opinion on it and its potential problems as well as attractive features. A local estate agent will also be invited to give their opinion on the property. The auction will then be shown and the final sale price revealed.
It is at this point we first meet the new buyer, and Martin or Lucy will interview them and find out their background, why they bought the property, whether they are happy with it given</desc>

Total Wipeout is a British game show, hosted by Richard Hammond and Amanda Byram, which first aired on 3 January 2009. Each week, 20 contestants compete in a series of challenges in an attempt to win £10,000. These challenges are based in large pools of water or mud and generally involve large assault courses that participants must cross.
The show is a licensed version of Wipeout, the Endemol show that originated in the United States in 2008, with the name slightly altered to avoid confusion with the BBC version of the earlier game show of the same name.
On 29 March 2012, BBC confirmed they are to axe the show after sixth series. The Mirror reported that a BBC spokesperson said: "After four very successful series of Total Wipeout, and one series of Winter Wipeout, the BBC has taken the decision that the next series, due to transmit later this year, will be the last." The remaining 10 episodes from Series 5 will be aired at some point later in 2012 and will end the show’s 4-year run on BBC One.
Endemol is understood to be working on a new format to replace Total Wipeout in the future.

The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.
The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox on May 15, 1998. The show was given the green light and started production. Shortly after the third season of Family Guy aired in 2001, Fox canceled the series. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004.

World News Today is a current affairs news programme produced by BBC News and presented by Zeinab Badawi. It was originally conceived as a morning television show aimed at American audiences, hosted by George Alagiah, but later expanded to six editions a day aimed at different markets. There is now one weekday edition only, part-simulcast on BBC Four and BBC World News.
The programme originally used the same graphics and music as BBC World, though when The World on BBC Four was renamed World News Today, all editions were given a separate set of graphics and music. Since April 2008 the standard title sequence used by the BBC's English Regions has been used, with some graphical alterations and with international images included. The first 30 mins of each broadcast is still simulcast on BBC Four.
As part of a channel refresh on BBC World News, five editions of World News Today were replaced on 1 February 2010 with GMT, Impact Asia, The Hub, Business Edition and a standard edition of BBC World News. On Fridays, the programme runs for 30 mins only, which means that BBC World News receive 2 bulletins of BBC World News instead. These air from 1930 to 1940UKT and 2000 to 2030UKT.

Great British Railway Journeys is a BBC travel documentary television series presented by Michael Portillo. The first series premiered on 4 January 2010 on BBC Two, running for 20 half-hour episodes; two further seasons followed in 2011 and in 2012, but with each season extended from 20 to 25 episodes; a fourth season is being filmed for release in early 2013. In the series, Portillo travels around the British railway network, guided by a Victorian guidebook written by George Bradshaw, and compares how the destinations have changed in Victorian and modern times.
Travelling around Great Britain by train, Portillo uses a copy of Victorian cartographer George Bradshaw's Railway Companion to compare and contrast modern Britain with that documented by Bradshaw in the 1840s, visiting recommended points of interest which would have been of interest to the Victorians. George Bradshaw was a cartographer who in 1840 became the first person to produce a comprehensive timetable and travel guide of the railway system in Great Britain, which at the time although extensive, still comprised a series of fragmented and competing railway companies and lines each publishing their own literature.

I've Never Seen Star Wars is a comedy chat show broadcast on BBC Four (2009 episodes) and BBC Two (2011 episodes), first broadcast on 12 March 2009. Created and produced by Bill Dare and hosted by Marcus Brigstocke for the 2009 episodes &amp; Jo Brand for the 2011 special episode, each episode features a celebrity guest trying out new experiences. Based on the original radio version broadcast on BBC Radio 4, the title comes from the fact that Dare has never seen the Star Wars films. An eight part series was recorded in March 2009, with guests including John Humphrys, Esther Rantzen, Rory McGrath and Hugh Dennis.
A new host, Jo Brand, presented a December 2011 episode.
Each episode of I've Never Seen Star Wars features a different guest trying things they have never done before, and seeing whether they liked their experiences or not. Some of the experiences come from the show's special list, which contains a range of different experiences, such as certain books, films, foodstuffs etc. The experiences tend to a mixture of things from the list and things the guest wants to try out themselves.

Doctors is a British daytime television soap opera, set in the fictional Midland town of Letherbridge, defined as being close to the city of Birmingham, following the staff and their families of a doctor's surgery.
Doctors is produced by BBC Birmingham and is screened on BBC One, with the first episode broadcast on 26 March 2000. It was created by Chris Murray, with Mal Young developing it and Carson Black the original producer. The show has been shown at lunchtime since its inception, originally at 12.30pm as a lead-in to the BBC's One O'Clock News. After it was temporarily moved to allow for extended news coverage of the September 11th 2001 attacks, its regular slot changed to 2:10 pm, following directly after Neighbours, after ratings rose to a 25% audience share. When the BBC lost Neighbours to Channel 5 in January 2008, it moved into the Australian soap's old slot of 1:45pm. For a brief trial period in Summer 2000, selected episodes from the first series were shown on Fridays at 7 pm and from 16 February 2009, the show began transmitting in high definition on BBC HD at 4:00pm the same day.
Doctors was originally produced and broadcast in blocks of episodes, ranging from blocks</desc>

Bargain Hunt is a British television programme in which two pairs of contestants are challenged to buy antiques at a fair and then sell them in an auction for a profit. It has aired on BBC One since 13 March 2000 in a daytime version and from 22 August 2002 to 13 November 2004 in a primetime version. David Dickinson began as host of the daytime version and went on to also present the primetime version. Tim Wonnacott has presented the daytime version since 2003.
Bargain Hunt has undergone various format and rule changes since it premiered in 2000. Most episodes are 45 minutes in length, though 30-minute versions and one-hour "live" editions have also been produced.
Two teams – designated the "Reds" and the "Blues" – compete. Each team has two members, who wear matching T-shirts or fleeces that correspond to their team's colour. The contestants in most episodes are members of the public, though some shows feature teams of celebrity players instead. At the beginning of the show, each team is given a set amount of money with which to purchase antiques. The objective is to find items that will earn the team a profit when later sold at auction. Each team is accompanied by an antiques</desc>

He agreed to front the show to thank the Yorkshire Air Ambulance crew which flew him to hospital in their helicopter after his near-fatal jet engine powered car crash at Elvington Airfield near York.
Very high audience appreciation ratings (AIs) led the BBC to re-commission the show and it has been in production ever since. Several series have been repeated in a primetime slot in slightly shortened form. Since Series 2 it has been fronted by ex-cop and Crimewatch presenter Rav Wilding.
Helicopter Heroes is now on air in Australia, New Zealand and Scandinavia.
Unusually, it is entirely edited in a hangar at Leeds Bradford Airport and shot by a small team from BBC English regions using Sony EX3 HD cameras. Helicopter Heroes was among the first producer-shot observational documentary commissioned by the BBC HD Channel. They have flown more than 1,000 missions in the Yorkshire Air Ambulance's two MD900 Explorer helicopters.
Helicopter Heroes is well known for its dramatic air to air</desc>

Eggheads is a BBC quiz show created by 12 Yard Productions, first broadcast in 2003, and co-presented by Dermot Murnaghan and Jeremy Vine. For the 2008 series, Jeremy Vine was brought in to present on nights when Murnaghan was hosting the spinoff series Are You an Egghead? This happened again from October 2009 while Murnaghan presented the second series of the spinoff show. Since the spin-off show finished, Jeremy Vine has continued to host the second half of each series, which broadcasts 52 weeks a year. The show pits a team of five 'Eggheads' (made up from seven highly regarded quiz and game show champions, rotating each episode) against a series of teams of five 'challengers' who in each episode attempt to beat the Eggheads through a series of rounds. It is normally shown weekdays every week.
The title sequence consists of a voiceover by the host stating 'These people are amongst the greatest quiz players in Britain. Together they make up the Eggheads, arguably the most formidable quiz team in the country. The question is: can they be beaten?' The seven (five or six, if the episode is a repeat of a previous episode that aired when only five or six Eggheads existed respectively)</desc>

Freebase:
Great British Railway Journeys is a BBC travel documentary television series presented by Michael Portillo. The first series premiered on 4 January 2010 on BBC Two, running for 20 half-hour episodes; two further seasons followed in 2011 and in 2012, but with each season extended from 20 to 25 episodes; a fourth season is being filmed for release in early 2013. In the series, Portillo travels around the British railway network, guided by a Victorian guidebook written by George Bradshaw, and compares how the destinations have changed in Victorian and modern times.
Travelling around Great Britain by train, Portillo uses a copy of Victorian cartographer George Bradshaw's Railway Companion to compare and contrast modern Britain with that documented by Bradshaw in the 1840s, visiting recommended points of interest which would have been of interest to the Victorians. George Bradshaw was a cartographer who in 1840 became the first person to produce a comprehensive timetable and travel guide of the railway system in Great Britain, which at the time although extensive, still comprised a series of fragmented and competing railway companies and lines each publishing their own literature.

Newsnight is a BBC Television current affairs programme noted for its in-depth analysis and often robust cross-examination of senior politicians. Jeremy Paxman has been its main presenter for over two decades.
Several of the programme's editors over the years have gone on to senior positions within the BBC and elsewhere. Paxman's fellow presenters are Gavin Esler, Kirsty Wark and Emily Maitlis. Newsnight has been broadcast on BBC Two since 1980. It goes out on weekday evenings between 10:30pm and 11:20pm. Occasionally it may have an extended edition if there is an especially eventful event in the news - as happened on July 7 2011, when closure of the News of the World led to an extended version which went on until 11:35 pm. Recordings are available within the UK via the BBC website. A weekly 26-minute digest edition of Newsnight is screened on the corporation's international channel, BBC World News.
Newsnight in its current format began on 30 January 1980, although a shorter news bulletin of the same name had run in its late-night BBC2 slot during the 1970s. Its launch was delayed for four months by the Association of Broadcasting Staff, at the time the main BBC trade union.</desc>

Hardtalk (styled as HARDtalk) is a flagship BBC television programme, consisting of in-depth half-hour one-on-one interviews.
It is broadcast four days a week (Monday to Thursday) on BBC World News and the BBC News channel. Launched in 1997, much of its worldwide fame is due to its global reach via BBC World. Until early 2005, the host was Tim Sebastian, whose famous, and sometimes controversial, style of tough questioning brought a huge world audience to the show. It is normally broadcast late at night on the BBC News Channel. Until the mid-zeros, it was broadcast at around 11: 30 p.m., but in more recent times, it has been broaadcast later, at around half past twelve in the morning.
Since 2006, the show has been presented by Stephen Sackur, who was previously the BBC's correspondent in Washington and Brussels and who is an experienced interviewer who has grilled U.S. Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. He is occasionally replaced by several other well-known BBC presenters such as Zeinab Badawi, Carrie Gracie and Sarah Montague. Other occasional presenters have included Jon Sopel, David Jessel, Lyse Doucet, Nisha Pillai, Noel Thompson and Katya Adler.

I've Never Seen Star Wars is a comedy chat show broadcast on BBC Four (2009 episodes) and BBC Two (2011 episodes), first broadcast on 12 March 2009. Created and produced by Bill Dare and hosted by Marcus Brigstocke for the 2009 episodes &amp; Jo Brand for the 2011 special episode, each episode features a celebrity guest trying out new experiences. Based on the original radio version broadcast on BBC Radio 4, the title comes from the fact that Dare has never seen the Star Wars films. An eight part series was recorded in March 2009, with guests including John Humphrys, Esther Rantzen, Rory McGrath and Hugh Dennis.
A new host, Jo Brand, presented a December 2011 episode.
Each episode of I've Never Seen Star Wars features a different guest trying things they have never done before, and seeing whether they liked their experiences or not. Some of the experiences come from the show's special list, which contains a range of different experiences, such as certain books, films, foodstuffs etc. The experiences tend to a mixture of things from the list and things the guest wants to try out themselves. The guest and Brigstocke try out the experience and the guest gives their view on it, as well as</desc>

The World Tonight is an English-language newscast of the ABS-CBN News Channel (ANC) and formerly of ABS-CBN. It is anchored by Tina Monzon-Palma on weekdays, and by Gigi Grande on Saturdays and Ron Cruz on Sundays.
The World Tonight premiered on November 21, 1962 at 8:30pm on CBN's (predecessor of ABS-CBN) DZXL-TV Channel 9 as the network's answer to ABC's The Big News, News at Seven on GMA, and NewsWatch on RPN. Co-anchoring the newscast were Hal Bowie, a veteran announcer from ABS-CBN radio, Eric Eloriaga, and Henry Halasan, a former ABS-CBN Cebu talent who was transferred to the network's main offices in Manila as a sales executive. Bowie, who was in his 70s when the newscast first aired, later bowed out of the newscast due to health reasons and concentrated instead on producing news reports for the network. This left Halasan and Eloriaga as main anchorman of the program.
The program was transferred to sister station ABS Channel 3 on the 10:00pm time slot a year later. This happened when Channel 9 premiered Newsbreak with Bong Lapira, who transferred from rival newscast The Big News on ABC. The newscast continued until ABS-CBN's closure by the Marcos government during the</desc>

Drive is a short-lived American action drama television series created by Tim Minear and Ben Queen, produced by Minear, Queen, and Greg Yaitanes, and starring Nathan Fillion, four episodes of which aired on the Fox network in April 2007. Two unaired episodes were later released directly to digital distribution.
The series is set across the backdrop of an illegal automobile road race with the central focus being on the unwitting competitors and, as the plot develops, the unseen puppet masters who sponsor the race. Minear has described the show's thematic tone by saying "a secret, illegal, underground road race can be anything from Cannonball Run to The Game to North by Northwest to Magnolia-on-wheels. Ours is all those things."
Firefly and Serenity star Nathan Fillion, a longtime friend of series creator Tim Minear, plays the lead role of Alex Tully. Ivan Sergei played Tully in the unaired pilot.
The show premiered on April 13, 2007 on CTV in Canada. It debuted in the United States on April 15, 2007 on Fox, and moved into its regular time slot on Mondays the next day; in that slot it faced stiff competition from NBC's Deal or No Deal and ABC's Dancing with the Stars. On April 25,</desc>

Up All Night is an American television comedy series created by Emily Spivey that premiered on NBC on September 14, 2011, at 10 p.m. (E_P), before assuming its regular time slot on Wednesday, September 21, 2011, at 8 p.m. (E_P). The show stars Christina Applegate, Will Arnett, Jennifer Hall and Maya Rudolph. The series was moved to Thursdays, airing after The Office, on January 12, 2012. On May 11, 2012, the series was renewed for a second season. The second season will feature 13 episodes.
The series follows Reagan (Christina Applegate), a producer on her best friend Ava's (Maya Rudolph) talk show, and Chris (Will Arnett), Reagan's supportive, stay-at-home husband, as they try to adjust to life with their newborn baby Amy.
The series was based on creator Emily Spivey's life when she went back to working on Saturday Night Live after giving birth to a baby boy. Due to the nature of her job, she was required to take care of the baby and work late nights. She decided she wanted to make a show based off those extremes. NBC executives were "supportive and excited" for the new series. On February 1, 2011, Up All Night received a pilot order, written by creator Spivey and directed by</desc>

Bananas in Pyjamas is an Australian children's television show that premiered on 20 July 1992 on ABC. It has since become syndicated in many different countries, and dubbed into other languages. In the United States, the "Pyjamas" in the title was modified to reflect the American spelling pajamas. This aired in syndication from 1995 to 1997 as a half-hour series, then became a 15-minute show paired with a short-lived 15-minute series The Crayon Box, under a 30-minute block produced by Sachs Family Entertainment titled Bananas in Pajamas &amp; The Crayon Box. Additionally, the characters and a scene from the show were featured in the Kids for Character sequel titled Kids for Character: Choices Count. The pilot episode was Pink Mug.
The concept was inspired by the success of the song Bananas in Pyjamas, written by Carey Blyton in 1967, on Play School. This song, which had become a regular item on Play School, became the theme of the new series.
The series was revamped in May 2011, now as a CGI series created by Southern Star Entertainment.
The main characters are two humanoid bananas named B1 and B2. Other characters include three teddy bears named Amy, Lulu and Morgan, and Rat in a Hat.</desc>

The Pink Panther shorts are reminiscent of the classic DePatie-Freleng Panther shorts from the 1960s and the 1970s, from art direction, silent acting, musical scoring, and story lines. The Pink Panther remains silent throughout the show, and has been aged down as a teenager. The Panther also gains a sidekick named Hoarse, based on the horse he had troubles with in Pinto Pink and Pink Valiant. The panther's enemy The Little Man has been renamed to "Big Nose" for this series with vocal effects provided by Alex Nussbaum. The Little Man's canine companion Dog has been</desc>

The Flintstones is an animated, prime-time American television sitcom that was broadcast from September 30, 1960 to April 1, 1966, on ABC. The original pilot episode clip however was called the "Flagstones" (which first appeared in 1959 as a 90 second promotion to draw advertisers to the show) and was later reincorporated into the show's 1st episode (3rd episode in original airdate order). The show's name was changed to "The Flintstones" shortly thereafter. The show was produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions, The Flintstones was about a working class Stone Age man's life with his family and his next-door neighbor and best friend.
The show's continuing popularity rested heavily on its juxtaposition of modern everyday concerns in the Stone Age setting.
The show is set in the Stone Age town of Bedrock. (In some of the earlier episodes, it was also referred to as "Rockville".) In this fantasy version of the past, dinosaurs, saber-toothed tigers, woolly mammoths, and other long-extinct animals co-exist with cavemen. Like their mid-20th century peers, these cavemen listen to records, live in split-level homes, and eat out at restaurants, yet their technology is made entirely from</desc>

Wacky Races is an animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera. The series features 11 different cars racing against each other in various road rallies throughout North America, with each driver hoping to win the title of the "World's Wackiest Racer." Wacky Races ran on CBS from September 14, 1968, to January 4, 1969. Seventeen episodes were produced, with each episode featuring two different races.
The cartoon had an unusually large number of regular characters, with twenty-three people and animals spread among the 11 race cars, plus the unseen (and never identified) race announcer. Reruns of the series currently air several times a day on Cartoon Network's classic animation network Boomerang.
One of the unused plans for the series was that the races would be part of a live-action quiz show made by Merrill Heatter and Bob Quigley Productions in which contestants would bet on which Wacky Racer would cross the finish line first. Although the game show concept was eventually scrapped, the series still retained a Hanna-Barbera_Heatter-Quigley dual production credit.

Top Cat is a Hanna-Barbera prime time animated television series which ran from September 27, 1961 to April 18, 1962 for a run of 30 episodes on the ABC network. Reruns are played on Cartoon Network's classic animation network Boomerang.
Originally broadcast on Wednesdays [8:30-9pm Eastern], Top Cat was co-sponsored by Kellogg's and Bristol-Myers (Bufferin). The central character, Top Cat—called T.C. by close friends, "pro-vid-ing it's with dignity" as the lyrics of the theme song say—is the leader of a gang of Manhattan alley cats: Fancy, Spook, Benny the Ball, Brain, and Choo Choo living in Hoagie's Alley.
Top Cat and his gang were inspired by characters from the popular situation comedy You'll Never Get Rich (later called The Phil Silvers Show). Maurice Gosfield, who played Private Duane Doberman on The Phil Silvers Show, also provided the voice for Benny the Ball in Top Cat (Benny's rotund appearance was based on Gosfield too). Even Arnold Stang's voicing of Top Cat strongly resembled Phil Silvers' voice. Another possible source material was Hokey Wolf, a segment on The Huckleberry Hound Show, which also had parallels to The Phil Silvers Show.

Chowder is an American animated television series which ran from November 2, 2007 to August 7, 2010 on Cartoon Network. The series was created by C. H. Greenblatt, a former storyboard artist on SpongeBob SquarePants and The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy.
During his time working on Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants, Greenblatt had been sketching various characters for his own animation series concept. Greenblatt originally based the premise on the idea of the sorcerer's apprentice style of story, such as The Sword in the Stone. The plot devices were modified so that the story revolves around a master chef who teaches his young apprentice how to cook. Chowder himself was developed with no specific species in mind, but rather with the intentions of invoking the image of a child's soft squeeze toy. Some of the inspiration comes from Richard Scarry, with other inspiration from Saturday morning cartoons.
Once Greenblatt pitched the concept to Cartoon Network, it was about two years before the series was approved for production with another year in production before the pilot episode aired. Greenblatt estimates he spent about seven years working on Chowder before the show made it to</desc>

When Cartoon Network Development Studio Europe was created in 2007, Ben Bocquelet was hired in order to help people pitch their projects to the network. However, when the studio decided to have its employees all pitch their own ideas, he decided to take some of the rejected characters he had created for commercials and put them all in one series, with a school setting. Daniel Lennard, the Vice President of Original Series and Development at Turner Broadcasting UK, liked the idea and the series was ultimately greenlit.

Johnny Bravo is an American animated television series created by Van Partible for Cartoon Network. The series stars a muscular beefcake young man named Johnny Bravo who dons a pompadour hairstyle and an Elvis Presley-like voice and has a forward, woman-chasing personality. Plots typically revolve around him trying to get a woman that he has targeted throughout the episode to fall in love with him. He is often beaten up or stunned by his target or companions, or is ditched by them in the end.
The series was originally part of a series of shorts on Cartoon Network's animation showcase series World Premiere Toons (also known as the The What a Cartoon! Show.) The popularity of the shorts led to the network commissioning a full series for the show, which premiered on July 14, 1997. The series was renewed for multiple following seasons and finally ended its official run on August 27, 2004.
The series was the second series to be spun from World Premiere Toons, and is the second series under Cartoon Cartoons (a collective name for early Cartoon Network original series). A spin-off of the series, JBVO, was unsuccessful and ran for one season. Many of the writers and directors on the series</desc>

Samurai Jack is an American animated television series created by animator Genndy Tartakovsky that aired on both Cartoon Network and Toonami from 2001 to 2004. It is noted for its highly detailed, outline-free, masking-based animation, as well as for its cinematic style and pacing. It was the first Cartoon Network original series aside from those who comprised the Cartoon Cartoons lineup at the time. It is shown on its sister network Boomerang.
The plots of individual episodes range from dark and epic to light-hearted and comic, but typically follow "Jack", a time-displaced samurai warrior, in his singular quest to find a method of traveling back in time. Many of the battle scenes in the series are reminiscent of samurai films, and since Jack's robotic enemies "bleed" oil or electricity and monsters and aliens bleed slime or goo, the series is able to exhibit the action of these films while avoiding censorship for violence.
Samurai Jack is no longer available to be viewed by American residents via the Toonami Jetstream website. Production on the show was halted in 2004, but it was never officially ended. In return, Tartakovsky has announced plans to direct a theatrical film, but</desc>

Chowder is an American animated television series which ran from November 2, 2007 to August 7, 2010 on Cartoon Network. The series was created by C. H. Greenblatt, a former storyboard artist on SpongeBob SquarePants and The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy.
During his time working on Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants, Greenblatt had been sketching various characters for his own animation series concept. Greenblatt originally based the premise on the idea of the sorcerer's apprentice style of story, such as The Sword in the Stone. The plot devices were modified so that the story revolves around a master chef who teaches his young apprentice how to cook. Chowder himself was developed with no specific species in mind, but rather with the intentions of invoking the image of a child's soft squeeze toy. Some of the inspiration comes from Richard Scarry, with other inspiration from Saturday morning cartoons.
Once Greenblatt pitched the concept to Cartoon Network, it was about two years before the series was approved for production with another year in production before the pilot episode aired. Greenblatt estimates he spent about seven years working on Chowder before the show made it to</desc>

Animated boy Little Howard and his live-action guardian Big Howard live together in Purley, London.

Further assistance is provided by Mother, a pink anthropomorphic personal computer that wears clothes and feels emotions.
Although the programme is broadcast on the BBC, which does not show commercial advertising, each episode features a comedy "advertising break" with imaginary products vaguely related to the big question. Similarly, a frequent element throughout</desc>

The Story of Tracy Beaker is a television programme adapted from the book of the same name by Jacqueline Wilson. It ran on CBBC for five series, from 2002 to 2006 and also contained a feature length episode, Tracy Beaker's Movie of Me, broadcast in 2004, as well as a week of interactive episodes for Children in Need. The theme song was written and performed by Keisha White. All of the five series have been released on DVD.
The series is the story of various children in a British carehome, told through its lead Tracy Beaker. In the first three series Tracy lived at the carehome and the stories revolved around her desire to leave the home, nicknamed by the kids as "The Dumping Ground". By the start of the fourth series, Tracy has been fostered by author Cam Lawson, the events of this are depicted in The Movie of Me. Because of this, the focus of the programm sifts slightly with the plots now focusing on Cam and Tracy's relationship while back at "The Dumping Ground" characters such as Jackie, Crash, Lou and Bouncer have been taking over Tracy's narrative role there.

Shaun the Sheep is a British stop-motion animated children's television series produced by Aardman Animations, and commissioned by the British Broadcasting Corporation and West German Broadcasting, a member of the Consortium of public-law broadcasting institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunkanstalten der Bundesrepublik Deutschland). It is a spin-off of the Wallace and Gromit franchise, starring Shaun from A Close Shave as its main protagonist. It first aired in the UK on CBBC in March 2007. The show consists of 80 episodes in 2 seasons, and is currently on hiatus. It has been broadcast in 180 countries around the world. The series has also inspired its own spin-off show, Timmy Time, which is aimed at younger viewers.
A premise of the series is that Shaun the sheep exhibits human intelligence, creativity, and behaviour in a farm setting, which usually provides a situational comedy conflict which Shaun must resolve before the end of each episode. Recurring themes include the characters evading the sheepdog Bitzer (though he is sometimes with the sheep in their escapades) and avoiding discovery by the Farmer.

Newsround (originally called John Craven's Newsround, before the departure of Craven) is a BBC children's news programme, which has run continuously since 4 April 1972, and was one of the world's first television news magazines aimed specifically at children. Initially commissioned as a short series by BBC Children's Department, who held editorial control, its facilities are provided by BBC News. The programme is aimed at 6 to 12-year-olds.
Originally known as John Craven's Newsround, it was mostly presented by John Craven between 4 April 1972 and 22 June 1989. Originally, stand-in presenters came from main BBC News bulletins, including Richard Whitmore. The programme's reporter was Lucy Mathen. By the 1980s, the programme had developed its own presentation team including Roger Finn and Helen Rollason with Craven in the dual role of chief presenter and programme editor.
Shortly before Craven's departure, the show was renamed Newsround, and was now anchored by a rotating team of presenters. Past presenters have included David Bull, Juliet Morris, Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Julie Etchingham, Chris Rogers, Kate Sanderson, Matthew Price, and Becky Jago.

Tikkabilla is a UK children's television programme, shown on BBC1, BBC2 and on the CBeebies channel.
The programme aims to educate pre-school children in an entertaining manner. The title "Tikkabilla" comes from the Punjabi word meaning "Hopscotch", a popular children's game. It was an exceptionally well loved childrens television show.
Each programme is introduced by two adults and a small dragon puppet named Tamba, whom resembles Spyro the Dragon in colouration. Tamba serves as the programme's naive child; the programme's educational content is introduced as the presenters explain things to Tamba. Whilst Tamba appears in every episode, a team of presenters take it in turns to pair-up in each show. These presenters include Justin Fletcher, Sarah-Jane Honeywell, Paul Ewing, Simon Davies, Lorna Laidlaw, Veejay Kaur, Toni Fruitin and Amit Sharma (both series 4 only) and Beverley Hills (series 1-3 only). Tamba is performed by puppeteers Sue Eves (series 1 - 4) who created the voice for Tamba; Alison McGowan (series 2 &amp; 3) and Katherine Smee (series 4).

Chuggington is a British computer-animated television series for children produced by Ludorum plc and on the BBC children's channel CBeebies and other 175 territories throughout the world.
The series is set in the fictional town of Chuggington, and follows the adventures of 6 young novice railway anthropomorphic locomotives, (or "Trainees",) named Wilson, Brewster, Koko, Hoot, Toot and Piper. Throughout each episode the Trainees learn the value of loyal friendship, telling the truth, listening carefully, persisting under adversity, completing tasks, resolving conflict without violence, and many similar important life values. In the show, the locomotives, called "Chuggers", are all intelligent, empathetic, independent and self-directed, with mobile facial features. None of the Chuggers are ever seen to have a crew, although there are several human characters that the Chuggers interact with regularly. This despite the fact that many of the chuggers have crew doors which the chuggers can open and close on their own. Each chugger tends to talk in ways that emphasize their distinct personalities.

Iain Lauchlan was a presenter on Play School, Fingermouse and Playdays, meeting Brenton, a director, writer and also a presenter, during the latter. Together they started producing two of the Playdays strands before forming their own production companies Tell-Tale Productions and, more recently, Wish Films. They also created The Fun Song Factory, Boo!, BB3B!, Jim Jam and Sunny, Basil Hair The Squirrel and Entertainment Right's The Magical Lives of Toys.
Tweenies was a production of Tell-Tale Productions in association with the BBC.

Big Barn Farm is a live-action television series commissioned by Michael Carrington at the BBC, narrated by Ben Fairman in series 1 and Dave Lamb in series 2. The programmes are about four young animals, the Farmyard Bunch - Petal the piglet, Gobo the ‘kid’ goat, Dash the young donkey and Digger the puppy - and their view of life on Big Barn Farm. Their adventures on the farm revolve around their emotions and the situations they find themselves in. As the Farmyard Bunch explore the day to day routine of life on a farm, so they play, discover and have fun.
As the storylines are from the young animals’ point of view there is as much importance placed on whether the farmer has forgotten feeding time as where’s the best place to hide in a game of hide and seek.
In each adventure the Farmyard Bunch explore their friendships and role on the farm. They can be cheeky, often get up to mischief and find themselves in tricky situations. But as a foursome they always find a solution and learn something along the way.
And the Farmyard Bunch aren’t alone on the farm. There are the duck girls who live noisily on the pond; the gossipy Mrs Chickens; a very tall horse called Mack; a flock of wilful</desc>

The series, which initially began as an interactive minisite on the CBeebies website, began airing on CBeebies from March 12, 2012.
The series revolves around a show bug host named Lingo and his family of bugs, who each specialise in a different language. At the request of children, Lingo and his team travel around the UK to perform a Big Bug Show using one of their star performers. In each episode, the chosen bug searches around for props required for their act, introducing potential objects in their respective language, before bringing them back to Lingo so they can perform their Big Bug Show in front of the delighted preschool children.

ZingZillas is a television programme aimed at young children, broadcast on the BBC pre-school channel CBeebies.
ZingZillas is a music show aimed at the under sixes.
It is set on a monkey-shaped tropical island where everyone joins in to create music magic. They use musical influences from all over the globe from rock to soul, jazz to samba, big band to orchestra.
A yellow submarine is sometimes seen in the sea near the island. One episode contains what appears to be a view from the submarine through its periscope. In a recently-started 5-minute version called Zingzillas Zingbop, the submarine goes very near the viewpoint, showing children inside the submarine through its portholes; those children later take part in the programme's singing and dancing session, as if (in the world of the story) the submarine is the usual transport for guests to and from the island.
The main characters are primates: Zak, Tang, Panzee and the youngest, Drum. They are mentored by music guru DJ Loose and they create their unique ZingZilla sound just in time for their daily performance which is called 'The Big Zing'.

Gigglebiz is a children's television programme (a 'live action comedy sketch show') made in the UK. There have been two series, first broadcast on CBeebies , the BBC's younger children's channel, in 2009 and 2011.
The programme's star and creator is Justin Fletcher, who plays the chief characters in all the comic sketches. Some sketches are filmed in the studio; one regular external location is Portmeirion, used for the town of Wiggyville where the Captain Adorable sketches are set. The sketches are interspersed with 'Giggle Box' - film segments of children viewers telling Justin jokes.
The first series was broadcast in September 2009 and comprised 25 15-minute episodes. The second series of 15 episodes was shown in January 2011 (with a Christmas Special on Wednesday December 15, 2010). The new series saw some characters disappear to make way for new ones.
Scottish comedian Robert Florence auditioned for the show and was subsequently rejected.

Grandpa In My Pocket is a comedy drama series commissioned by Michael Carrington for CBeebies, the BBC's dedicated pre-school and nursery channel targeting children under the age of 6 years. The programme stars James Bolam, Jay Ruckley, Josie Cable, Zara Ramm and Sam Ellis. The story centres on Grandpa (James Bolam), who owns a magical Shrinking Cap, which only his grandson Jason (Jay Ruckley) knows about. This cap enables him to shrink to about 4 or 5 inches tall and experience many magical adventures which are told via voice-over narration by Jason, including finding a hamster under the floorboards and bringing a home-made robot to life.
When miniaturized, he has enough magic power to make Jason's toy car and toy biplane and toy railway locomotive work as the real vehicles including making engine noise, and drive them. Jason has a simple toy glider made of two pieces of wood in the shape of a seagull which he calls Gordon; Grandpa, when miniaturized, can ride on this and make it fly like a real seagull.
When miniaturized, Grandpa can jump much farther in proportion than in full size, and can also "run for all he's worth", as Jason puts it.

64 Zoo Lane is a children's cartoon created by An Vrombaut.
It features a 7 year-old girl named Lucy who lives at 64 Zoo Lane, next door to a Zoo. Each night she is told a story by the animals present there. Characters include Georgina the Giraffe, Nelson the Elephant, Tickles and Giggles the Monkeys, Boris the Bear, and Molly the Hippopotamus. The cartoon emphasizes friendship and responsibility. At the story's end, friendly morals are discussed, then bed-time is declared. Georgina deposits Lucy into bed via the bedroom window (later episodes show Lucy yawning then sleeping soundly in bed; in the original episodes she would be lulled to sleep by the storytelling itself).
There are many opportunities for learning: exploring language and vocabulary are enhanced by the use of intonation and expression in the character's voices and the themes of the animals' stories support social and emotional issues, including friendships and helping and caring for others.
In the United Kingdom 64 Zoo Lane is shown on CBeebies, often as part of the lineup of the Bedtime Hour, and on Playhouse Disney. In the United States 64 Zoo Lane formerly aired on Nick Jr. at 1:00 AM &amp; 1:30 AM, but currently</desc>

Tikkabilla is a UK children's television programme, shown on BBC1, BBC2 and on the CBeebies channel.
The programme aims to educate pre-school children in an entertaining manner. The title "Tikkabilla" comes from the Punjabi word meaning "Hopscotch", a popular children's game. It was an exceptionally well loved childrens television show.
Each programme is introduced by two adults and a small dragon puppet named Tamba, whom resembles Spyro the Dragon in colouration. Tamba serves as the programme's naive child; the programme's educational content is introduced as the presenters explain things to Tamba. Whilst Tamba appears in every episode, a team of presenters take it in turns to pair-up in each show. These presenters include Justin Fletcher, Sarah-Jane Honeywell, Paul Ewing, Simon Davies, Lorna Laidlaw, Veejay Kaur, Toni Fruitin and Amit Sharma (both series 4 only) and Beverley Hills (series 1-3 only). Tamba is performed by puppeteers Sue Eves (series 1 - 4) who created the voice for Tamba; Alison McGowan (series 2 &amp; 3) and Katherine Smee (series 4). Sue Eves has also written many scripts for the programme.

The Hoobs is a BAFTA-winning children's television programme created and produced by The Jim Henson Company.
In the United Kingdom, it is a regular feature in early morning schedules. The show is made in the UK, as are many other Jim Henson Company productions. It was commissioned for Channel 4, and was shown at around the times of 6:00am to 7:00am regularly since January 2001, when the show started. It has also been shown for other countries, including North America (repeats formerly airing on PBS Kids Sprout).
It stars five creatures called Hoobs (Hubba Hubba, Iver, Groove, Tula, and Roma) from the fictional Hoobland, and their interactions with Earth and the human race. In each episode, they try to find the answer to a question to be put in the great Hoobopaedia created by Hubba Hubba, back in Hoobland, in hopes of learning all there is to know. Hubba Hubba remains in Hoobland to await the report from the other Hoobs; Iver, Groove, and Tula live in the Hoobmobile; and Roma travels to all parts of the world. The five creatures are puppets, but the show also includes some animated sequences as well as live motion of human children who explain concepts to the Hoobs.

According to Jim is an American sitcom television series starring Jim Belushi in the title role as a suburban father of three children. It originally ran on ABC from October 3, 2001 to June 2, 2009.
Jim is an abrasive but lovable suburban father. Much like his real life counterpart, Jim's character is noted as a fan of blues music, as well as the Chicago Bears, Chicago Cubs, Chicago Bulls and the Chicago Blackhawks. Together with his wife Cheryl, whose middle name is Mabel, they have three children, daughters Ruby and Gracie and son Kyle. In the seventh season they become parents of a pair of twins Jonathan and Gordon.
Jim often finds himself in messy situations because his laziness inclines him to search for alternative ways of doing things with least effort. While Cheryl's brother Andy may be Jim's best friend, her sister Dana frequently teams up with Cheryl against Jim. He also prefers to lie to Cheryl and Dana to do his own activities but they end up backfiring on him. He hates losing to women (e.g. Hot Dog Eating Contests, Hamburger Eating Contests, Pizza Eating Contests, Pot Pie Eating Contests), especially if Cheryl or Dana find out.

The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series is a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle epitomized by its family of the same name, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture, society, television and many aspects of the human condition.
The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox, becoming the network's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989–1990).
Since its debut on December 17, 1989, the show has broadcast 508 episodes and the twenty-third season started airing on September 25, 2011. The Simpsons is the longest-running American sitcom, the longest-running American animated program, and in</desc>

Hollyoaks is a long-running British television soap opera, first broadcast on Channel 4 on 23 October 1995. It was originally devised by Phil Redmond, who has also devised shows including Brookside and Grange Hill. The programme is set in a fictional suburb of Chester called Hollyoaks and is centred around a local further education college called Hollyoaks Community College, with the characters generally being in their late teens or early twenties. Since 1995, the cast has expanded from just seven major characters to approximately 50 cast members. Since the long-serving producer Bryan Kirkwood quit in 2009, the role of series producer has seen several changes. Kirkwood's successor Lucy Allan stepped down from her position in 2010 after just twelve months, and her replacement, former The Bill producer Paul Marquess took control later that year. Like his predecessor, Marquess left the series after a year and Gareth Philips was appointed as series producer. Emma Smithwick later replaced Phillips as a permanent replacement. Smithwick was a series editor of the soap for a while, before taking on the role of producer in Autumn 2011.

Supersize vs Superskinny is a British television programme on Channel 4 that features information about dieting and extreme eating lifestyles. One of the main show features is a weekly comparison between an overweight person, and an underweight person. The two are brought to a feeding clinic, and live together for five days, swapping diets all supervised by Dr Christian Jessen.
The show also featured Anna Richardson in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd series, who examined new methods to lose weight by trying diets she finds on the Internet, some of which have shocking side effects. For example, Anna attempted Laser lipolysis, which went drastically wrong and resulted in severe bruising. Also, she discovered Diabulimia and spoke to Isabelle Caro, a French actress, renowned for her underweight figure and anorexia campaign.
During the first series in 2008, one feature involved Gillian McKeith, who tried to find a way to "ban big bums" in the UK. She tested out different exercises to tone bums on different groups of ladies, and made a leader board for the most effective.

    <desc lang="en">Back for a new series. Host Jimmy Carr and team captains Sean Lock and Jon Richardson are joined by Jack Dee, Claudia Winkleman, David O'Doherty and Josh Widdicombe join in the first show.
Freebase:
8 out of 10 Cats is a British television comedy panel game made by Zeppotron (a subsidiary of Endemol) for Channel 4. It was first broadcast on 3 June 2005. The show is based on statistics and opinion polls, and draws on polls produced by a variety of organizations and new polls commissioned for the programme, carried out by company Harris Poll. The show's title is derived from a well-known advertising tagline for Whiskas cat food which originally claimed that "8 out of 10 cats prefer Whiskas". The first advert ever screened during the show's commercial break was for Whiskas.
The show is hosted by comedian Jimmy Carr and features two teams, consisting of a regular team captain and two celebrity guests each. Sean Lock has appeared as the first team captain since the show's inception; the opposing captain was originally Dave Spikey, who left after series 4 to pursue other projects and was replaced by Jason Manford. Manford departed following series 10, and has been replaced by Jon Richardson in the current series.
Every week, the captains are joined by two celebrities from the likes of David Walliams and Alan Carr. Often, topical celebrities appear on the show, for example Ruth</desc>

Freebase:
Play Your Cards Right (or Bruce Forsyth's Play Your Cards Right) is a British television game show based on the American show known as Card Sharks. The gameplay was basically the same as in the American version.
Play Your Cards Right broadcast on ITV from 1980 to 1987, produced by London Weekend Television. The host was Bruce Forsyth. LWT produced a more modern version from 1994 to 1999, initially expected to be presented by Brian Conley who filmed a pilot show before Forsyth was lured back. In 2002, Bruce hosted another revival, with slightly modified rules. This version was produced by Thames Television. On 15 October 2005 it made a one-off return as part of Ant &amp; Dec's Gameshow Marathon, celebrating 50 years of ITV. It made another one-off return in 2007 again part of Gameshow Marathon. Forsyth also presented a parody of the format, Play Your Iraqi Cards Right (originally titled Play Your Kurds Right), when he was guest host on the satirical BBC TV series Have I Got News for You. Play Your Cards Right has also been turned into a successful Interactive DVD which was released in 2007, with an updated sequel released in 2008, both produced by DVDPro.

Freebase:
The Philippine version of 1 vs. 100 was first aired on ABS-CBN on August 25, 2007. It is hosted by veteran Filipino quiz host Edu Manzano, from Pilipinas, Game KNB?, and Weakest Link. A single player (The One) goes up against 100 other contestants (The Mob). The One gains money for each mob member eliminated, but if the One answers incorrectly at any point of the game, the game ends and he or she leaves with nothing. The grand prize of the show is P2,000,000.
The program is the fourth franchise the network acquired from its creator Endemol and it is also the most expensive, due to the studio's sheer size to accommodate the Mob.
The first season ended on April 19, 2008. Its run was supposed to have ended a long time ago, as the program revealed, but it was extended twice due to popular demand.
The Philippine version is similar to the US format (before its rules were reformatted) and the new European format used in Italy and France. Contestants are given multiple-choice questions with three possible answers. Either The One or the Mob (or its remaining members) can win the prize depending on whether The One can answer the questions correctly. After answering a question correctly, mob</desc>

Freebase:
Eggheads is a BBC quiz show created by 12 Yard Productions, first broadcast in 2003, and co-presented by Dermot Murnaghan and Jeremy Vine. For the 2008 series, Jeremy Vine was brought in to present on nights when Murnaghan was hosting the spinoff series Are You an Egghead? This happened again from October 2009 while Murnaghan presented the second series of the spinoff show. Since the spin-off show finished, Jeremy Vine has continued to host the second half of each series, which broadcasts 52 weeks a year. The show pits a team of five 'Eggheads' (made up from seven highly regarded quiz and game show champions, rotating each episode) against a series of teams of five 'challengers' who in each episode attempt to beat the Eggheads through a series of rounds. It is normally shown weekdays every week.
The title sequence consists of a voiceover by the host stating 'These people are amongst the greatest quiz players in Britain. Together they make up the Eggheads, arguably the most formidable quiz team in the country. The question is: can they be beaten?'

Pointless is a quiz show shown on BBC One, hosted by Alexander Armstrong, with Richard Osman as an assistant. It has been broadcast since 24 August 2009.
Similar to Family Fortunes, contestants must give answers to a question which had previously been asked to one hundred members of the public. However, there are important differences:
The object of the game is to score as few points as possible by giving correct answers that the public have or have not given, ultimately scoring lower than other contestants. The contestants particularly try to look for answers that score no points, which are known as "Pointless" answers. Finding a Pointless Answer adds £250 to the jackpot in rounds prior to the Final, and finding a Pointless Answer in the Final wins the game.
At the beginning of the show there are four teams (five in the first series) of two players. Any team which does not reach the final of the show on their first appearance is invited back for a second (and final) appearance on the next show.
The aim of the show is to get as few points as possible, by answering questions with lesser known correct answers.

Golden Balls was a British daytime game show on the ITV network, presented by Jasper Carrott, that aired from 18 June 2007 to 18 December 2009. It was filmed at the BBC Television Centre. From 25 February 2008 to 13 February 2009, the show was sponsored by ITV Bingo (powered by Party Gaming) (STV Bingo in Scotland); and from 2 November to 18 December 2009, the show was sponsored by Carpet Right. Golden Balls Ltd licensed their name to Endemol for the game show and merchandise.
At the back of the studio is the "Golden Bank", a giant contraption like a lottery machine. Inside it, are 100 golden balls, containing cash values, ranging from £10 to £75,000 (in the unaired pilot, the highest valued ball was £200,000 and £100,000 was also present). Twelve of these balls are randomly drawn from the machine and four "Killer" balls are added by Amanda Grant, the "Balls' Assistant". These sixteen balls are split equally and randomly among four contestants. Each contestant places two balls on his front row and two on his back row. The balls on the front row are visible to all contestants; the balls on the back row are visible only to their owner.

Freebase:
Brainiac: Science Abuse (often shortened to simply Brainiac) is a British entertainment TV show with a science motif. Numerous experiments are carried out in each show, often to verify whether common conceptions are true (such as whether it is possible to run across a pool of custard) or simply to create impressive explosions. The show centres on the three core branches of science for the key stages in British education: chemistry, physics and to a lesser extent, biology. The experimenters on the show are referred to as "Brainiacs", and each episode usually finishes with the destruction of a caravan.
The show is produced by ITV umbrella studios Granada Productions (collaboration between London Weekend Television and Granada Television in Manchester) and is broadcast in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland on Sky Digital.
The original presenters were Richard Hammond and Jon Tickle, then joined in the second series by Charlotte Hudson. Hammond left after the fourth, and was replaced by Vic Reeves and Hudson left after the fifth, and was replaced by Thaila Zucchi. The show's fifth series first aired on 8 May 2007 and the sixth, on 13 January 2008.

Takeshi's Castle (??!????, Fuun! Takeshi-jo, literally Showdown! Takeshi Castle) is a Japanese game show that aired between 1986 and 1989 on the Tokyo Broadcasting System. It featured the Japanese actor Takeshi Kitano (also known as Beat Takeshi) as a count who owns a castle and sets up difficult challenges for players (or a volunteer army) to get to him. The show has become a cult television hit around the world. A special live "revival" was broadcast on April 2, 2005, for TBS's 50th anniversary celebrations.
The original show involved between 100 and 142 contestants whom General Lee (Hayato Tani) "forced" into a series of silly physical challenges, eliminating many of the contestants. Each show finished with a "Final Showdown" in which Count Takeshi (Kitano) was faced by the remaining contestants. In early episodes they would storm the castle set itself in a short-range water gun assault. Later episodes introduced carts with paper rings, and eventually lasers and light-sensitive targets.

    <desc lang="en">Annabel Croft hosts this 1980s adventure game show in which two contestants attempt to win £1,000 through hide and seek-style challenges, avoiding the Interceptor along the way.
Freebase:
Interceptor was a British game show created by Jacques Antoine, Jean Jacques Pasquier and Malcolm Heyworth. It was produced by Chatsworth Television for Thames Television in 1989, and shown on the ITV network during that summer, with one last episode held back and shown on 1 January 1990 for a New Year special. It was made in between Treasure Hunt and The Crystal Maze, game shows from the same production company.
The show was hosted by former tennis player and Treasure Hunt sky-runner Annabel Croft. The eponymous Interceptor was played by actor Sean O'Kane.
Interceptor was received well by critics and viewers, yet only eight episodes (one series) were made. Nonetheless, the show has something of a cult following, which influenced re-runs on digital TV channel Challenge from 2001 onwards. A public vote by UKGameshows.com in 2002 saw the series voted the UK's 13th best game show.
Each episode of the series was based, like Treasure Hunt, in a region of the UK, and began from a local tourist attraction. The host, Annabel Croft, would introduce the episode's two contestants, one woman (the yellow contestant) and one man (the blue contestant). Each contestant would be given a locked</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Adventure game show based on the hit French series in which contestants complete physical and endurance challenges. Christopher Ellison, Jodie Penfold and Tom Baker present.
Freebase:
Fort Boyard is a French game show created by Jacques Antoine that was first broadcast in 1990 (as Les Clés de Fort Boyard, shortened for the second series in 1991) and is popular to this day. It has been re-made across the globe, most successfully in the following countries: the United Kingdom, Sweden, Lebanon, Norway, Canada, Russia, Denmark, Belgium, Israel, the Netherlands, Greece, Armenia and most recently in Poland and Finland over a 20-year period.
Set and filmed on the real Fort Boyard in France, the programme appears similar to The Crystal Maze (which was created by Antoine for Channel 4 in the United Kingdom after Fort Boyard itself was unavailable to film in because of its then ongoing refurbishment). In both programmes the contestants have to complete challenges to win prize money. However, while The Crystal Maze varies the type of games quite considerably, Fort Boyard tends to focus mainly on physical and endurance challenges. Although Fort Boyard was something of a pioneer in the area of game show fear and adventure, later programmes such as Fear Factor have pushed things even further, requiring Fort Boyard to react and adapt with new twists and games, including a</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In a game of truth and bluff, contestants try to find which of the 100 golden balls conceal life-changing amounts of cash and which contain the dreaded killer balls.
Freebase:
Golden Balls was a British daytime game show on the ITV network, presented by Jasper Carrott, that aired from 18 June 2007 to 18 December 2009. It was filmed at the BBC Television Centre. From 25 February 2008 to 13 February 2009, the show was sponsored by ITV Bingo (powered by Party Gaming) (STV Bingo in Scotland); and from 2 November to 18 December 2009, the show was sponsored by Carpet Right. Golden Balls Ltd licensed their name to Endemol for the game show and merchandise.
At the back of the studio is the "Golden Bank", a giant contraption like a lottery machine. Inside it, are 100 golden balls, containing cash values, ranging from £10 to £75,000 (in the unaired pilot, the highest valued ball was £200,000 and £100,000 was also present). Twelve of these balls are randomly drawn from the machine and four "Killer" balls are added by Amanda Grant, the "Balls' Assistant". These sixteen balls are split equally and randomly among four contestants. Each contestant places two balls on his front row and two on his back row. The balls on the front row are visible to all contestants; the balls on the back row are visible only to their owner.

Freebase:
It’s Not What You Know was a game show, hosted by Chris Tarrant, which aired on the British digital TV channel Challenge in 2008. The show was unusual as Challenge tends to air repeats of classic game shows that were originally commissioned by other broadcasters, very rarely producing original content.
The game is played by a team of two (friends, relatives, etc.). First of all, they are given three games to play: A, B or C. To help them, one celebrity "expert" and their specialist subject from each game is shown. The players must choose one of the games and, once they have, the other four celebrities and their specialist subjects in the chosen game are revealed. Each game contains 15 questions with each question being specific to one of the celebrity's specialist subject.
The first question comes up with four possible answers. The specialist celebrity did not receive the four options, the other celebrities did. We then see the correct answer (it does not matter if the players got it right or wrong). The players then have to decide on which celebrity they think got the question incorrect (in other words, which celebrity was "stumped"). There were at least four occasions of the</desc>

Seasons are taped during the previous fall (king crab) and winter (C. opilio) crab seasons.

MythBusters is a science entertainment TV program created and produced by Australia's Beyond Television Productions for the Discovery Channel. The series is screened by numerous international broadcasters, including Discovery Channel Australia, Discovery Channel Latin America, Discovery Channel Canada, Quest, SBS Australia, 7mate Australia and the Discovery Channel in the UK. The show's hosts, special effects experts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, use elements of the scientific method to test the validity of rumors, myths, movie scenes, adages, Internet videos, and news stories. The show is one of the oldest – and the most popular – on Discovery Channel currently in production, being preceded in the US only by How It's Made. In Canada, Daily Planet is older.
Filming is based in San Francisco, though some elements of production are done in Artarmon, Australia. Planning and some experimentation takes place at Hyneman's workshops in San Francisco; experiments requiring more space or special accommodations are filmed on location, typically around the San Francisco Bay area and other northern California places, going elsewhere when required, such as Florida for alligator experiments, or</desc>

Swamp Loggers is an American reality television series on the Discovery Channel that follows the crew of Goodson's All Terrain Logging as they log the swamps of North Carolina (mostly in Pender County where much of the series is filmed).
Some of the running themes of the show include trying to get 100 loads of lumber shipped out per week, which gets the crew a bonus about 100 dollars and a BBQ paid for by Bobby and cooked by Dave (75 loads is generally considered the "break even" point where Bobby's expenses are covered), the constant difficulties encountered with bad weather, poor road conditions, and equipment failures. As well as uncertainties concerning lumber buyers, land owners (whose grounds that Goodson's is hired to work on), and saw mills.
Another issue that was featured during several episodes was the emergency gall bladder surgery performed on truck driver "Bo-Bo", the effect on his family and co-workers, and his recovery (he has since returned to Goodson's with a clean bill of health).</desc>

Good Luck Charlie is an original Disney Channel television sitcom, which premiered April 4, 2010. The series was created by Phil Baker and Drew Vaupen, who wanted to create a program that would appeal to entire families, as opposed to children only. It revolves around a Denver family, the Duncans, as they try to adjust to the birth of their fourth child, Charlotte "Charlie" Duncan (Mia Talerico). In each episode, Teddy Duncan (Bridgit Mendler) creates a video diary containing advice for Charlie about their family and life as a teenager. Teddy tries to show Charlie what she might go through when she is older in the video diaries for future reference. Each video diary ends with Teddy (or someone else from the family, even Charlie) saying the eponymous phrase, "Good luck, Charlie."
Among other decisions, executives included adult-centric scenes and changed the series title from Oops to Love, Teddy and finally to Good Luck Charlie in order to ensure the series would appeal to all family members. Good Luck Charlie premiered on Disney Channel in the United States on April 4, 2010. It premiered in Canada on April 5, 2010, the United Kingdom and Ireland on May 14, 2010, and in Australia</desc>

Phineas and Ferb is an American animated television comedy-musical series. Originally broadcast as a preview on August 17, 2007, and officially premiered on February 1, 2008 on Disney Channel, the series follows Phineas Flynn and his English stepbrother Ferb Fletcher on summer vacation. Every day, the boys embark on some grand new project, which annoys their controlling sister, Candace, who frequently tries to reveal their shenanigans to her and the boys' mother, Linda Flynn-Fletcher, and less frequently to their father, Lawrence Fletcher. The series follows a standard plot system; running gags occur every episode, and the B-Plot almost always features Perry the Platypus acting as a secret agent ("Agent P") for the OWCA (Organization Without a Cool Acronym), to fight an evil scientist named Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz. However, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, or Doof as he refers to himself, feels the need to assert his evilness. Sometimes, other villains scoff at his level of evil. The two plots intersect at the end to erase all traces of the boys' project just before Candace can show it to their mother. This usually leaves Candace very frustrated.

Art Attack is a British children's television series revolving around art. The original series was one of ITV's longest running programmes, running from 1990 to 2007, and was presented throughout by Neil Buchanan.
The new series launched on Disney Junior (UK &amp; Ireland) on 6 June 2011 and was presented by Jassa Ahluwalia. Each show involved Ahluwalia voicing-over footage of an artist producing three works of art, taking the viewer through the various stages of production step by step.
The show is hosted with different hosts from around the world.
Art Attack was the art programme described by Neil Buchanan that "Gives your eyeballs a shock!". This was because of the mad style of art usually done on the programme and to make art more fun for children. The art shown on the show was easy for children to follow and most 'Art Attacks' could be done using things found around the home. Buchanan very rarely used shop bought art materials.
The show was well known for quite often having messy Art Attacks, such as 'Plop Art' (dropping egg shells full of paint onto paper) and 'Splat attack!' (smashing paint soaked cotton wool balls on pieces of paper with fly swatters). Most messy art attacks</desc>

How to Be Indie was a Canadian television show on YTV. The main character is a 13 year old Indian Canadian teenager named Indira "Indie" Mehta. The program is a single-camera series intended for a youth audience. The series was created by Vera Santamaria, John May, and Suzanne Bolch. The series is currently airing its second season, and aired the final episode on October 24, 2011 on YTV in Canada and May 26, 2012 on Disney Channel in the UK.
The program follows Indie's journey as she tries to get the most out of life despite the travails of junior high school and her "strict" Indian parents. She is joined by her two best friends Marlon Parks and Abigail "Abi" Flores. She often falls into the trap of caring more about what her peers think of her than who she wants to be herself, and consequently spends a lot of time trying to impress her classmates. When not focussing on Indie, the show focusses on Marlon and Abi. A given episode will usually show Marlon's quirky antics getting him into a troublesome situation. Abi will have to help extricate him, which she willingly does, feeling pity on him. Sometimes, however, they swap roles as Marlon tries to play it cool.

Good Luck Charlie is an original Disney Channel television sitcom, which premiered April 4, 2010. The series was created by Phil Baker and Drew Vaupen, who wanted to create a program that would appeal to entire families, as opposed to children only. It revolves around a Denver family, the Duncans, as they try to adjust to the birth of their fourth child, Charlotte "Charlie" Duncan (Mia Talerico). In each episode, Teddy Duncan (Bridgit Mendler) creates a video diary containing advice for Charlie about their family and life as a teenager. Teddy tries to show Charlie what she might go through when she is older in the video diaries for future reference. Each video diary ends with Teddy (or someone else from the family, even Charlie) saying the eponymous phrase, "Good luck, Charlie."
Among other decisions, executives included adult-centric scenes and changed the series title from Oops to Love, Teddy and finally to Good Luck Charlie in order to ensure the series would appeal to all family members. Good Luck Charlie premiered on Disney Channel in the United States on April 4, 2010. It premiered in Canada on April 5, 2010, the United Kingdom and Ireland on May 14, 2010, and in Australia</desc>

One Tree Hill is an American television drama created by Mark Schwahn, which premiered on September 23, 2003, on The WB Television Network. After the series' third season, The WB merged with UPN to form The CW Television Network, and since September 27, 2006, the network has been the official broadcaster of the series in the United States. The show is set in the fictional town of Tree Hill in North Carolina and originally follows the lives of two half-brothers, Lucas Scott (Chad Michael Murray) and Nathan Scott (James Lafferty), who compete for positions on their school's basketball team. Their relationship evolves from heartless enemies to caring brothers as the show progresses, and the drama that ensues from the brothers' romances with female characters and from the basketball atmosphere are significant elements within the series.
The first four seasons of the show focus on the main characters' lives through their high school years. With the beginning of the fifth season, Schwahn advanced the timeline by four years to show their lives after college, and he made it jump a further fourteen months from the end of the sixth to the start of the seventh season.

Hollyoaks is a long-running British television soap opera, first broadcast on Channel 4 on 23 October 1995. It was originally devised by Phil Redmond, who has also devised shows including Brookside and Grange Hill. The programme is set in a fictional suburb of Chester called Hollyoaks and is centred around a local further education college called Hollyoaks Community College, with the characters generally being in their late teens or early twenties. Since 1995, the cast has expanded from just seven major characters to approximately 50 cast members. Since the long-serving producer Bryan Kirkwood quit in 2009, the role of series producer has seen several changes. Kirkwood's successor Lucy Allan stepped down from her position in 2010 after just twelve months, and her replacement, former The Bill producer Paul Marquess took control later that year. Like his predecessor, Marquess left the series after a year and Gareth Philips was appointed as series producer. Emma Smithwick later replaced Phillips as a permanent replacement. Smithwick was a series editor of the soap for a while, before taking on the role of producer in Autumn 2011.

Scrubs is an American medical comedy-drama television series which ran from October 2, 2001 to March 17, 2010 on NBC and ABC. The series, which follows the lives of employees at the fictional Sacred Heart teaching hospital, was created by Bill Lawrence. The title is a play on surgical scrubs and a term for a low-ranking person because at the beginning of the series, most of the main characters were medical interns.

Scrubs is an American medical comedy-drama television series which ran from October 2, 2001 to March 17, 2010 on NBC and ABC. The series, which follows the lives of employees at the fictional Sacred Heart teaching hospital, was created by Bill Lawrence. The title is a play on surgical scrubs and a term for a low-ranking person because at the beginning of the series, most of the main characters were medical interns.

Charmed is an American television series that originally aired from October 7, 1998, until May 21, 2006, on the now defunct The WB Television Network. The series was created by writer Constance M. Burge and was produced by Aaron Spelling and his Spelling Television company, with the show runner being writer-director Brad Kern.
The series follows the four Halliwell sisters—Prue, Piper, Phoebe and, later on in the series, Paige (who replaces Prue from season 4 onwards). The sisters are the culmination of the most powerful line of good witches in history and are known as The Charmed Ones in the supernatural community, whose prophesized destiny is to protect innocent lives against evil beings such as demons and warlocks. Each sister possesses unique magical powers that grow and evolve, while they attempt to hold normal working lives in modern day San Francisco. Keeping their supernatural identities separate and secret from their ordinary lives often becomes a challenge for them, with the exposure of magic having far-reaching consequences on their various relationships and resulting in a number of police and FBI investigations throughout the series.

Three other supporting characters have also been promoted to starring roles: Leslie Winkle, a physicist colleague at Caltech and, at different times, a lover of both Leonard and Howard who left the show after season 3; Bernadette Rostenkowski, Howard's fiancée and now wife, who is a microbiologist and former part-time waitress alongside Penny; and Amy Farrah Fowler, a neuroscientist who joins the group after being matched to Sheldon</desc>

Hollyoaks is a long-running British television soap opera, first broadcast on Channel 4 on 23 October 1995. It was originally devised by Phil Redmond, who has also devised shows including Brookside and Grange Hill. The programme is set in a fictional suburb of Chester called Hollyoaks and is centred around a local further education college called Hollyoaks Community College, with the characters generally being in their late teens or early twenties. Since 1995, the cast has expanded from just seven major characters to approximately 50 cast members. Since the long-serving producer Bryan Kirkwood quit in 2009, the role of series producer has seen several changes. Kirkwood's successor Lucy Allan stepped down from her position in 2010 after just twelve months, and her replacement, former The Bill producer Paul Marquess took control later that year. Like his predecessor, Marquess left the series after a year and Gareth Philips was appointed as series producer. Emma Smithwick later replaced Phillips as a permanent replacement. Smithwick was a series editor of the soap for a while, before taking on the role of producer in Autumn 2011.

CSI: Miami (Crime Scene Investigation: Miami) is an American police procedural television series which ran from September 23, 2002 to April 8, 2012 on CBS. It is the first spin-off of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.
The pilot episode was first broadcast in United States on May 9, 2002, as an episode of CSI from the second season. The series was produced in partnership with the Canadian media company Alliance Atlantis and CBS Television Studios.
On February 1, 2012, it was announced that the tenth season of CSI: Miami would be trimmed to nineteen episodes to make room for the debut of midseason replacement NYC 22. On May 13, 2012, both series were canceled.
CSI: Miami was filmed primarily in the United States. Indoor scenes were shot at Raleigh Manhattan Studios in Manhattan Beach, California. The majority of all outdoor scenes were filmed in Long Beach, California, as well as portions of Manhattan Beach and Redondo Beach. Beach areas of Downtown Long Beach were often used for other outdoor scenes: Marina Green Park and Rainbow Lagoon Park. The newly constructed high-rise condos there gave the pretense of being in Miami.

NCIS, formerly known as NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service, is an American police procedural drama television series revolving around a fictional team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which conducts criminal investigations involving the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.
The concept and characters were initially introduced in a two-part episode of the CBS series JAG (JAG episodes 8.20 and 8.21). The show, a spin-off from JAG, premiered on September 23, 2003 on CBS and, to date, has aired nine full seasons and has gone into syndicated reruns on USA Network, Cloo (formerly Sleuth), and Ion Television. Donald Bellisario, who created JAG as well as the well-known series Airwolf, Magnum, P.I., and Quantum Leap, is co-creator and executive producer of NCIS.
NCIS was originally referred to as Navy NCIS during season one; however, the word "Navy" was later dropped from the title as it was redundant. In season seven, NCIS was joined by a spin-off series, NCIS: Los Angeles, starring Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J.
In 2011, NCIS was voted as America’s favorite television show. On March 14, 2012, CBS renewed NCIS for a 10th season.

CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (also known as CSI: Las Vegas) is an American crime drama television series, which premiered on CBS on October 6, 2000. The show was created by Anthony E. Zuiker and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. It is filmed primarily at Universal Studios in Universal City, California.
The series follows Las Vegas criminalists (identified as "Crime Scene Investigators" working for the Las Vegas Police Department (LVPD) instead of the actual title of "Crime Scene Analysts" and "Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department"(LVMPD)) as they use physical evidence to solve grisly murders in this unusually graphic drama, which has inspired a host of other cop-show "procedurals". The series mixes deduction, gritty subject matter and character-driven drama. The network later added spin-offs CSI: Miami and CSI: NY. On March 14, 2012, CBS renewed CSI for its 13th season.
CSI has been recognized as the most popular dramatic series internationally by the Festival de Télévision de Monte-Carlo, which has awarded it the "International Television Audience Award (Best Television Drama Series)" three times. CSI's worldwide audience was estimated to be over 73.8 million viewers in 2009.</desc>

Chuck is an action-comedy_spy-drama television program from the United States created by Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak. The series is about an "average computer-whiz-next-door" named Chuck, played by Zachary Levi, who receives an encoded e-mail from an old college friend now working for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); the message embeds the only remaining copy of the United States' greatest spy secrets into Chuck's brain.
Produced by College Hill Pictures, Fake Empire, Wonderland Sound and Vision and Warner Bros. Television, the series premiered on September 24, 2007, on NBC, airing on Monday nights at 8_7c.
As the second season closed, flagging ratings put Chuck in danger of cancellation, but fans mounted a successful campaign to encourage NBC to renew the show. The campaign was unique in that fans specifically targeted a sponsor of the show, the Subway restaurant chain, and the chain struck a major sponsorship deal with NBC to help cover costs of the third season. The series' renewal was uncertain in each subsequent season. The fifth season was the last; it began on October 28, 2011, moving to Friday nights at 8pm_7 Central.

Burn Notice is an American television series created by Matt Nix. The show stars Jeffrey Donovan, Gabrielle Anwar, Bruce Campbell, Sharon Gless, and, beginning in the fourth season, Coby Bell. The series premiered on June 28, 2007, on USA Network. On April 15, 2010, the show was renewed for its fifth and sixth seasons. The sixth season, set to include between 16 and 18 episodes, began on June 14, 2012.
The title of the series refers to the burn notices issued by intelligence agencies to discredit or announce the dismissal of agents or sources who are considered to have become unreliable. When spies are burned, their connection to an espionage organization is terminated, leaving them without access to cash or influence. According to the narration during the opening credits, the burned spy has no prior work history, no money, no support network – in essence, no identity. The television series uses first-person narrative (including frequent voice-overs providing exposition) from the viewpoint of covert-operations agent Michael Westen, played by Jeffrey Donovan. The voice-over commentary is in the form of tips for fledgling agents as if for a training or orientation film.

Neighbours is an Australian television soap opera. It was first broadcast on the Seven Network on 18 March 1985. It was created by TV executive Reg Watson, who proposed the idea of making a show that focused on realistic stories and portrayed adults and teenagers who talk openly and solve their problems together. Seven decided to commission the show following the success of Watson's Sons and Daughters, which aired on the network. Although successful in Melbourne, Neighbours underperformed in the Sydney market and struggled for months before Seven cancelled it. The show was immediately bought by rival network Ten. After taking over production of the show, the new network had to build replica sets because Seven destroyed the originals to prevent its rival from obtaining them. Ten began screening Neighbours on 20 January 1986, taking off where the previous series left off and commencing with episode 171. Neighbours has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and in 2005, it was inducted collectively into the Logie Hall of Fame. On 11 January 2011, Neighbours moved to Ten's new digital channel, Eleven.

Well, that was me. Every time something good happened to me, something bad was always waiting round the corner: karma. That's when I realized that I had to change, so I made a list of everything bad I've ever done and one by one I'm gonna make up for all my mistakes. I'm just trying to be a better person. My name is Earl."
The series stars Jason Lee, Ethan Suplee, Jaime Pressly, Eddie Steeples and Nadine Velazquez (Lee and Suplee had also worked together on the film "Mallrats" more than ten years prior). Earl J.

Neighbours is an Australian television soap opera. It was first broadcast on the Seven Network on 18 March 1985. It was created by TV executive Reg Watson, who proposed the idea of making a show that focused on realistic stories and portrayed adults and teenagers who talk openly and solve their problems together. Seven decided to commission the show following the success of Watson's Sons and Daughters, which aired on the network. Although successful in Melbourne, Neighbours underperformed in the Sydney market and struggled for months before Seven cancelled it. The show was immediately bought by rival network Ten. After taking over production of the show, the new network had to build replica sets because Seven destroyed the originals to prevent its rival from obtaining them. Ten began screening Neighbours on 20 January 1986, taking off where the previous series left off and commencing with episode 171. Neighbours has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and in 2005, it was inducted collectively into the Logie Hall of Fame. On 11 January 2011, Neighbours moved to Ten's new digital channel, Eleven.

Babylon 5 is an American space opera television series created by writer and producer J. Michael Straczynski, under the Babylonian Productions label in association with Straczynski’s Synthetic Worlds Ltd. and Warner Bros. Domestic Television.

It premiered in the United States on January 26, 1994 and ran for the intended five seasons. Describing it as having "always been conceived as, fundamentally, a five year story, a novel for television", Straczynski wrote 92 of the 110 episodes and served as executive producer, along with Douglas Netter.
Set between the years 2257 and 2262, it depicts a future where earth has sovereign states and a unifying Earthgov.

Family Guy is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the Griffins, a dysfunctional family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.
The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox on May 15, 1998. The show was given the green light and started production. Shortly after the third season of Family Guy aired in 2001, Fox canceled the series. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004.
Family Guy has been nominated for 12 Primetime Emmy Awards and 11 Annie Awards, and has won three of each. In 2009, it was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, the first</desc>

Family Guy is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the Griffins, a dysfunctional family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.
The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox on May 15, 1998. The show was given the green light and started production. Shortly after the third season of Family Guy aired in 2001, Fox canceled the series. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004.
Family Guy has been nominated for 12 Primetime Emmy Awards and 11 Annie Awards, and has won three of each. In 2009, it was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, the first</desc>

Loose Women is a British lunchtime television programme, first broadcast in 1999 on ITV. It consists of a panel of four women who interview celebrities and discuss topical issues, ranging from daily politics and current affairs, to celebrity gossip. Each series typically airs from the beginning of September of one year to the start of August of the next, while also taking a break over Christmas.
Due to a decline in ratings between January and June 2011, changes were made to the show upon the launch of its sixteenth series that September. Changes included a new lineup: anchor Kate Thornton and panellists Zoe Tyler and Coleen Nolan left the show, while new presenter Carol Vorderman and panellist Sally Lindsay both started on the programme.
The panel comprises four women from various professions in the entertainment and journalism industries, including actresses, singers, authors, presenters, journalists and reporters. Although all four women are classed as presenters in the credits, one acts as the main anchor, linking to breaks and competitions and addressing the television audience.

The seller then decides whether to accept or decline the deal. If the deal is declined items go to auction.

The Alan Titchmarsh Show is a British daytime TV chat show broadcast between 3 and 4pm weekdays on the ITV Network.
The programme made its debut on ITV in 2007. It focused on the theme of "The Best of British" focusing on food, entertainment and celebrities in a mid-afternoon slot. The focus of the show later shifted towards gossip, entertainment and a light-hearted discussion of sex tips. The latter was toned down after viewer complaints and a shift to a late afternoon 5pm slot in 2010. The show usually opens with a review of gossip and current affairs stories of the day with regular guests including Gloria Hunniford, Carole Malone, Penny Smith, Nick Ferrari, Janet Street Porter, Jane McDonald and Emma Forbes offering their opinions. The programme resumes the studio debate format at half-past the hour with a "heated" discussion on the main "hot topic" of the day. The programme also includes regular cookery slots with Ainsley Harriot and Rosemary Shrager with Titchmarsh adopting a comical, "hands-on" role as a hopeless cookery assistant. In Shrager's cookery demonstrations, the pair often alternate between bickering and flirting with visual "humour" and numerous double entendres</desc>

Created by Kevin Laffan, Emmerdale was first broadcast on 16 October 1972. It is produced by Yorkshire Television, now part of ITV Studios, and has been filmed at their Yorkshire Studios since its inception. It has since been shown in all regions of ITV almost throughout its existence. It is the United Kingdom's second oldest soap opera and the third most popular behind Coronation Street and EastEnders.
It was originally conceived and broadcast as a daytime programme in an afternoon slot, becoming an early evening programme in 1978 in most ITV regions, but excluding London and Anglia, both of which followed in the mid-1980s. Until Christmas 1988, Emmerdale took seasonal breaks; since then it has been broadcast year-round.

Loose Women is a British lunchtime television programme, first broadcast in 1999 on ITV. It consists of a panel of four women who interview celebrities and discuss topical issues, ranging from daily politics and current affairs, to celebrity gossip. Each series typically airs from the beginning of September of one year to the start of August of the next, while also taking a break over Christmas.
Due to a decline in ratings between January and June 2011, changes were made to the show upon the launch of its sixteenth series that September. Changes included a new lineup: anchor Kate Thornton and panellists Zoe Tyler and Coleen Nolan left the show, while new presenter Carol Vorderman and panellist Sally Lindsay both started on the programme.
The panel comprises four women from various professions in the entertainment and journalism industries, including actresses, singers, authors, presenters, journalists and reporters. Although all four women are classed as presenters in the credits, one acts as the main anchor, linking to breaks and competitions and addressing the television audience.

ITV Nightscreen is a scheduled programme on the United Kingdom's ITV television network, consisting of a sequence of animated pages of information about ITV's upcoming programmes, features and special events, with an easy listening music soundtrack. The programme is used to fill the station's overnight downtime, where a closedown would have once been used at the end of programmes. Previously it began after the final programme in the night and finishes at 05:30 every day, but recently ITV have started airing The Jeremy Kyle Show at 4:30am-5:30am, giving Nightscreen a shorter airtime with it starting usually at around 3:15-3:45 and finishing at 4:30.
It was first broadcast in 1998, and consisted of teletext pages taken from the ITV regional teletext services, with interstitial teletext-based animations in a similar style to the former 4-Tel On View, which had also been produced by the Intelfax). Since 2003 the screens have been produced using Scala InfoChannel3.

Maury (sometimes known as The Maury Povich Show) is a syndicated American tabloid talk show hosted by Maury Povich.
When the series first aired in 1991, the show was called The Maury Povich Show and was produced by MoPo Productions in association with Paramount Domestic Television. The show adopted the title Maury in the 1995–1996 season. The show was then revamped in the 1998–1999 season, when Studios USA (now NBCUniversal) took over production. However, MoPo continues to co-produce with NBCUniversal. For the series' first 18 seasons, it was taped in New York City, but beginning with Season 19, the show has been taped in the Stamford Media Center in Stamford, Connecticut. Maury is one of four NBC Universal syndicated properties to make the move to Connecticut, joining the former Chicago-based Jerry Springer and Steve Wilkos shows. (The fourth, the syndicated Deal or No Deal, is no longer in production.) But the TV rating on Maury has been rated TV-G, TV-PG, and TV-14 on the syndicated stations of the United States, based on each episode's content.
Maury has dealt with a variety of issues across its 21 seasons, including – but not limited to – teenage pregnancy, sexual infidelity,</desc>

It is videotaped at the Stamford Media Center in Stamford, Connecticut and is distributed by NBC Universal Television Distribution, although it is not currently broadcast on any NBC-owned stations.
The Jerry Springer Show is ostensibly a talk show where troubled or dysfunctional families come to discuss their problems before a studio audience so that the audience or host can offer suggestions on what can be done to resolve their situations. In actuality, the show has come to epitomize the so-called "trash TV talk show", which frequently result in fighting between guests. At one point, the show proudly boasted that it was voted the "Worst TV Show Ever" by TV Guide magazine. The show also bragged to be "an hour of your life you'll never get back". The Jerry Springer Show has received widespread criticism and caused many controversies for a variety of reasons including its elements of prurience, explicit language and the exploitation of the vulnerable.

Bones is an American crime drama television series that premiered on the Fox network in the United States on September 13, 2005. The show is based on forensic anthropology and forensic archaeology, with each episode focusing on an FBI case file concerning the mystery behind human remains brought by FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz) to the forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance "Bones" Brennan (Emily Deschanel). The rest of the main cast includes Michaela Conlin, T. J. Thyne, Eric Millegan, Tamara Taylor, Jonathan Adams, and John Francis Daley.
Created by Hart Hanson, the series is very loosely based on the life and writings of novelist and forensic anthropologist Kathy Reichs, who also produces the show. Its title character, Temperance Brennan, is named after the protagonist of Reichs' crime novel series. Conversely, Dr. Brennan writes successful mystery novels based around a fictional (in the Bones universe) forensic anthropologist named Kathy Reichs. Bones is a joint production by Josephson Entertainment, Far Field Productions and 20th Century Fox Television.
On March 29, 2012, Fox renewed Bones for an eighth season.

Criminal Minds is an American police procedural television program that premiered September 21, 2005, on CBS. The series follows a team of profilers from the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) based in Quantico, Virginia. The BAU is part of the FBI National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime. Criminal Minds differs from many procedural dramas by focusing on the criminal rather than the crime itself. The show is produced by The Mark Gordon Company in association with CBS Television Studios and ABC Studios.
CBS announced in October 2009 that Legacy Interactive will develop a video game based on the show. The game will require players to examine crime scenes for clues to help solve murder mysteries. The interactive puzzle game was released in 2012 but did not feature any of the voices of the show's cast nor were the cast involved with the project.
On March 14, 2012, CBS renewed Criminal Minds for an eighth season.
When the series premiered in 2005, it featured FBI Agents Jason Gideon (Mandy Patinkin), Aaron Hotchner (Thomas Gibson), and the rest of the Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU). For Season 1, that team is composed of Agents Elle Greenaway (Lola Glaudini), Derek Morgan</desc>

CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (also known as CSI: Las Vegas) is an American crime drama television series, which premiered on CBS on October 6, 2000. The show was created by Anthony E. Zuiker and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. It is filmed primarily at Universal Studios in Universal City, California.
The series follows Las Vegas criminalists (identified as "Crime Scene Investigators" working for the Las Vegas Police Department (LVPD) instead of the actual title of "Crime Scene Analysts" and "Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department"(LVMPD)) as they use physical evidence to solve grisly murders in this unusually graphic drama, which has inspired a host of other cop-show "procedurals". The series mixes deduction, gritty subject matter and character-driven drama. The network later added spin-offs CSI: Miami and CSI: NY. On March 14, 2012, CBS renewed CSI for its 13th season.
CSI has been recognized as the most popular dramatic series internationally by the Festival de Télévision de Monte-Carlo, which has awarded it the "International Television Audience Award (Best Television Drama Series)" three times. CSI's worldwide audience was estimated to be over 73.8 million viewers in 2009.</desc>

Location, Location, Location is a Channel 4 property programme, presented by Kirstie Allsopp and Phil Spencer and produced by IWC Media, part of the RDF Media Group. The reality show follows Kirstie and Phil as they try to find the perfect home for a different set of buyers each week. It first aired in May 2000.
The 2007 series had a major revamp. The opening titles logo was changed and the format of the show altered. Instead of only one couple per week looking for a house in a town, two couples with different tastes look for a house in the same city with the presenters going back and forth to the different househunters. Each episode was extended to 60 minutes from the original 30. The first episode featured Glasgow and the second Sheffield.
A traditional turn of phrase used by property experts is that the three most important factors in determining the desirability of a property are "location, location, location". The phrase has been said to have been coined by Harold Samuel, though it appears in print as early as 1926.

Unfortunately, no final episode depicting the grim conclusion was filmed. Memorably, the series opened each week with a shot of extremely long shadows cast by Sullivan and Gulager on a western street (the "tall men").</desc>

Time Team is a British television series which has been aired on Channel 4 since 1994. Created by television producer Tim Taylor and presented by actor Tony Robinson, each episode features a team of specialists carrying out an archaeological dig over a period of three days, with Robinson explaining the process in layman's terms. This team of specialists has changed throughout the series' run, although has consistently included professional archaeologists like Mick Aston, Francis Pryor and Phil Harding. The sites that have been excavated over the show's run have ranged in date from the Palaeolithic right through to the Second World War.
Time Team developed from an earlier Channel 4 series, Time Signs, first broadcast in 1991. Produced by Taylor, Time Signs had featured Aston and Harding, who both went on to appear on Time Team. Following that show's cancellation, Taylor went on to develop a more attractive format, producing the idea for Time Team, which Channel 4 also picked up, broadcasting the first series in 1994.

Embarrassing Bodies (formerly Embarrassing Illnesses) is a British television programme broadcast by Channel 4 and made by Maverick Television since 2007. In 2011, a live show was introduced, "Embarrassing Bodies: Live from the Clinic", which consists of 47 minutes. Various spin-offs have been produced in relation to the programme to target different patients, such as Embarrassing Fat Bodies and Embarrassing Teenage Bodies.
The main objective of the programme is to aid people who have a wide range of ailments that they are "too embarrassed" to show to their doctor. The programme can also help viewers self-diagnose at home without attending a doctor's appointment. As well as showing patients' visits to the doctor, the possible effects of certain people's occupations, such as cyclists or football players, are also shown. The programme's success has attracted large numbers of people to its website.
Channel 4 has already worked with Kew Gardens on a database for natural plant remedies and medicines, and that was an online element of the Medicine Men series. The database invites contributions to the public and will eventually be turned over to Kew as a national, public resource.

Series 2 was announced on 7 December 2011 and ran for 8 episodes, viewing figures still held up strong and a third series was commissioned and has been filmed in Cancun, Mexico. A fourth series was also commissioned on 24 May 2012.
Although often compared to its contemporary reality shows The Only Way is Essex and Made in Chelsea, Geordie Shore is thought to be much less of a 'structured reality'. The events are presented more like a documentary and production forgoes the glossy, soap like style the previous programmes adopt. Members of crew can be seen to intervene when scenes on Geordie Shore are getting out of hand and this all enhances its reputation as Britain's most shocking reality</desc>

Winx Club is a 2004 Italian animated television series, created by Iginio Straffi and produced by Rainbow S.r.l.. The series is aimed toward children between the ages of five and twelve, but is also popular among teens. It has spawned an international franchise of toys, books, clothing, video games, DVDs, as well as two CGI feature films.
Apart from the English language version of the series done by Cinélume in Canada for various international markets, 4Kids Entertainment in the United States made an alternative version by changing dialogue and music and altering some visuals and situations. Their dub was discontinued in 2007 after the third season. In 2011, Nickelodeon aired four one-hour specials that summarizes seasons one and two, as well as airing seasons 3 and 4 in full complete seasons.
Iginio Straffi first wished to create a show aimed mainly at girls like Sailor Moon in 2000, when children's programming was dominated by boy-oriented shows.
The story follows Bloom and her friends Stella, Flora, Techna, Musa, Layla (Aisha), and is situated mainly in the Magical Dimension and on Earth. They call themselves "The Winx Club" and go on countless adventures together. Throughout</desc>

Genie in the House is a British situation comedy broadcast on Nickelodeon about a widowed father (Philip) with two teenage daughters (Emma and Sophie) who find a dusty old golden lamp while exploring the loft of their new home. A quick rub of the lamp releases Adil, a trainee genie from Balamkadaar who has been confined to life in the lamp for 1000 years. Philip has banned any use of magic in the house, yet the girls and Adil the Genie find ways to get themselves into trouble using Adil's wish granting powers. The mother is never mentioned, except on Adil's birthday when Philip mentions being a widower.
As of March 2012, Genie in the House is now airing on the Starz Kids &amp; Family cable network, replacing the Canadian comedy series Overruled!.
The show is based on an original idea — the collective work of Phil Ox (a French producer and Director), Steven Bawol (an American director who said he wanted to make England the 'New America'), Isabelle Dubernet and Eric Führer — and is a French_English co-production, produced in English by French company Moi j'aime la television.

Renford Rejects was a teen sitcom produced and broadcast by Nickelodeon UK between 1998 and 2001. The show briefly aired in the United States on Nick GaS.
The show concerned a five-a-side school football team, made up of aspiring players who had been turned down by their school's main team. They were named "Renford Rejects" when a rival player sabotaged their league entry form, but decided to stick with the name as it suited their "outcast" nature.
Series 1 was filmed in Autumn 1997, Series 2 in Autumn 1998, Series 3 in Autumn 1999, and Series 4 in Autumn 2000.
The show was filmed at Willesden Sports Centre, London, NW10 3QX. Eddie McAvoy's Gracelands Cafe was filmed at 118 College Road, Willesden, London NW10 5HD.
The 'Cafe' still exists to this current day.
The regular cast, as is often the case with teen sitcoms, went through a number of changes as its four series went by; however, characters who remained throughout the run included :
In the first two series, the team were coached by Stewart Jackson (Matthew Leitch), an upper-class older boy who had been the school team's star player until an injury (caused by Terry Stoker) prevented him from playing. He supports Chelsea and</desc>

Winx Club is a 2004 Italian animated television series, created by Iginio Straffi and produced by Rainbow S.r.l.. The series is aimed toward children between the ages of five and twelve, but is also popular among teens. It has spawned an international franchise of toys, books, clothing, video games, DVDs, as well as two CGI feature films.
Apart from the English language version of the series done by Cinélume in Canada for various international markets, 4Kids Entertainment in the United States made an alternative version by changing dialogue and music and altering some visuals and situations. Their dub was discontinued in 2007 after the third season. In 2011, Nickelodeon aired four one-hour specials that summarizes seasons one and two, as well as airing seasons 3 and 4 in full complete seasons.
Iginio Straffi first wished to create a show aimed mainly at girls like Sailor Moon in 2000, when children's programming was dominated by boy-oriented shows.
The story follows Bloom and her friends Stella, Flora, Techna, Musa, Layla (Aisha), and is situated mainly in the Magical Dimension and on Earth. They call themselves "The Winx Club" and go on countless adventures together. Throughout</desc>

Charlie's free-wheeling life is complicated when his brother gets divorced and moves, along with his son, into Charlie's beach-front Malibu house.

Two and a Half Men is an American television sitcom that premiered on CBS on September 22, 2003. Starring Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer, and Angus T. Jones, the show was originally about a hedonistic jingle writer, Charlie Harper; his uptight brother, Alan; and Alan's growing son, Jake. Charlie's free-wheeling life is complicated when his brother gets divorced and moves, along with his son, into Charlie's beach-front Malibu house. The series' premise was revamped in the ninth season, focusing on Alan moving on with his life after the death of Charlie with help from his new best friend and housemate, Walden Schmidt (Ashton Kutcher), who is also dealing with his own troubles following a bad divorce. Alan, Walden, and Jake eventually bond, becoming close friends, forming a surrogate family unit.
In 2010, CBS and Warner Bros. Television reached a multi-year broadcast agreement for the series, renewing it through at least the 2011_12 season. However, on February 24, 2011, CBS and Warner Bros. decided to end production for the rest of the eighth season due to Sheen entering drug rehabilitation and making "disparaging comments" about the show's creator and executive producer, Chuck Lorre.</desc>

South Park is an American animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone for the Comedy Central television network. Intended for mature audiences, the show has become famous for its crude language and dark, surreal humor that lampoons a wide range of topics. The ongoing narrative revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick—and their bizarre adventures in and around the titular Colorado town.
Parker and Stone, who met at college, developed the show from two animated shorts they created in 1992 and 1995. The latter became one of the first Internet viral videos, which ultimately led to its production as a series. South Park debuted in August 1997 with great success, consistently earning the highest ratings of any basic cable program. Subsequent ratings have varied but it remains one of Comedy Central's highest rated shows. It is Comedy Central's longest running program; a total of 230 episodes have aired, and the series is slated to run through at least 2016.

Scrubs is an American medical comedy-drama television series which ran from October 2, 2001 to March 17, 2010 on NBC and ABC. The series, which follows the lives of employees at the fictional Sacred Heart teaching hospital, was created by Bill Lawrence. The title is a play on surgical scrubs and a term for a low-ranking person because at the beginning of the series, most of the main characters were medical interns.
The series features fast-paced screenplay, slapstick, and surreal vignettes presented mostly as the daydreams of the central character, Dr. John "J.D." Dorian, who is played by Zach Braff. Actors starring alongside Braff in the first eight seasons included Sarah Chalke, Donald Faison, Neil Flynn, Ken Jenkins, John C. McGinley and Judy Reyes. The series has also featured multiple guest appearances by film actors, such as Brendan Fraser, Heather Graham, and Colin Farrell.
In the ninth season, many new cast members were introduced and the show setting moved from a hospital to a medical school.

Actors starring alongside Braff in the first eight seasons included Sarah Chalke, Donald Faison, Neil Flynn, Ken Jenkins, John C. McGinley and Judy Reyes. The series has also featured multiple guest appearances by film actors, such as Brendan Fraser, Heather Graham, and Colin Farrell.

Two and a Half Men is an American television sitcom that premiered on CBS on September 22, 2003. Starring Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer, and Angus T. Jones, the show was originally about a hedonistic jingle writer, Charlie Harper; his uptight brother, Alan; and Alan's growing son, Jake. Charlie's free-wheeling life is complicated when his brother gets divorced and moves, along with his son, into Charlie's beach-front Malibu house. The series' premise was revamped in the ninth season, focusing on Alan moving on with his life after the death of Charlie with help from his new best friend and housemate, Walden Schmidt (Ashton Kutcher), who is also dealing with his own troubles following a bad divorce. Alan, Walden, and Jake eventually bond, becoming close friends, forming a surrogate family unit.
In 2010, CBS and Warner Bros. Television reached a multi-year broadcast agreement for the series, renewing it through at least the 2011_12 season. However, on February 24, 2011, CBS and Warner Bros. decided to end production for the rest of the eighth season due to Sheen entering drug rehabilitation and making "disparaging comments" about the show's creator and executive producer, Chuck Lorre.</desc>

South Park is an American animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone for the Comedy Central television network. Intended for mature audiences, the show has become famous for its crude language and dark, surreal humor that lampoons a wide range of topics. The ongoing narrative revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick—and their bizarre adventures in and around the titular Colorado town.
Parker and Stone, who met at college, developed the show from two animated shorts they created in 1992 and 1995. The latter became one of the first Internet viral videos, which ultimately led to its production as a series. South Park debuted in August 1997 with great success, consistently earning the highest ratings of any basic cable program. Subsequent ratings have varied but it remains one of Comedy Central's highest rated shows. It is Comedy Central's longest running program; a total of 230 episodes have aired, and the series is slated to run through at least 2016.

M*A*S*H is an American television series developed by Larry Gelbart, adapted from the 1970 feature film MASH (which was itself based on the 1968 novel MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors, by Richard Hooker). The series is a medical drama and a black comedy that was produced in association with 20th Century Fox Television for CBS. It follows a team of doctors and support staff stationed at the "4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital" in Uijeongbu, South Korea, during the Korean War. M*A*S*H's title sequence featured an instrumental version of the song "Suicide Is Painless", which also appears in the original film. The show was created after an attempt to film the original book's sequel, M*A*S*H Goes to Maine, failed. It is the most well known version of the M*A*S*H works.
The series premiered in the US on September 17, 1972, and ended February 28, 1983, with the finale becoming the most watched television episode in U.S. television history at the time, with a record-breaking 125 million viewers, according to the New York Times.

Doug and Carrie Heffernan (Kevin James and Leah Remini) share their home at 3121 Aberdeen Street in Rego Park, Queens, New York (hence the show's title), with Carrie's oddball dad, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller).

Ffermio is a farming and countryside magazine series, which is broadcast on S4C on Monday nights at 8.25pm.
Ffermio was launched in 1997 and the original series was presented by Sulwyn Thomas, Gerallt Pennant and Rachael Garside, and dealt with the latest farming issues, as well as including the latest livestock market prices throughout Wales.
In 2005 the series was relaunched with a new branding and presenting team. The launch included the usual weekly Ffermio programme on S4C, and a twice-weekly farming news and weather bulletin on S4C Digidol. The new presenters included Iola Wyn, Daloni Metcalfe, Alun Elidyr and Mererid Wigley.
The Bwletin Ffermio included details on legislation and market prices for example, which meant that longer items could be featured in the half-hour programmes on subjects of wider appeal such as organic food, transport, health and rural housing, and portraits of rural characters from all ages and backgrounds. Mererid Wigley was the main presenter of this programme, until August 2008. Terwyn Davies joined the team as the Bwletin's presenter in summer 2008 until the series ended in May 2009.
In January 2011, Iola Wyn left her role as presenter after six</desc>

Sgorio is a Welsh football television programme broadcast in Wales on S4C and produced by Rondo Media. The regular presenter is Nic Parry, but the programme is sometimes presented by Morgan Jones or Alun Jones. It is broadcast on Monday evenings and specialised in highlighted coverage of European football particularly in the Spanish La Liga, Italian Serie A and German Bundesliga premier leagues.
Sgorio was first aired in 1988 and for the first decade or so included Rallying and other minority sports. For the past 10 years or so however it has concentrated solely on football.
The success of Sgorio, also extended outside Wales as avid English football fans, before cable or satellite television services, attempted to pick up S4C on their aerials just so they could watch the international football games being shown on Sgorio. The popularity of the show led Channel 4 to creating their own international football show in 1992.
Sgorio regularly used the famous Italian football cultural line "Golaccio!".
On 14 December 2009, an edition of Sgorio got the lowest rating in S4C's history, when it recorded a 'zero rating' (fewer than 2,500 viewers), according to the Broadcasters Audience</desc>

Ffeil (File) is a Welsh-language television news programme for children and young people, produced by BBC Cymru Wales for S4C.
Originally aired three times a week for 15 minutes (except during school summer holidays), Ffeil was later broadcast live for four and a half minutes every weekday afternoon throughout the year at 4:50pm, from the BBC's Broadcasting House in Llandaff, Cardiff. The programme was transmitted from Studio C2, the second largest studio in Broadcasting House. Following a re-launch in Spring 2012, Ffeil is now broadcast from Monday to Thursday from a virtual reality studio at 6.20pm. A reporter is also based at the BBC's North Wales newsroom in Bangor.
Although the programme has been compared greatly to its English-language counterpart, CBBC's Newsround, Ffeil differs in that it's produced directly by BBC Cymru's news and current affairs department (whereas Newsround is produced by CBBC with facilities provided by BBC News). The programme also has an expanded brief to cover Welsh regional news and features, alongside national and international news.

Pobol y Cwm (People of the Valley) is a Welsh-language television soap opera which has been produced by the BBC since October 1974. The longest-running television soap opera produced by the BBC, Pobol y Cwm was originally transmitted on BBC Wales television and later transferred to the Welsh-language station S4C when it opened in November 1982.
Rugby specials apart, Pobol y Cwm is consistently the most watched programme of the week on S4C, and in 1994 was briefly shown in the rest of the UK on BBC2 with English subtitles. Five episodes are produced each week, normally broadcast at 20.00 every weeknight, with a repeat (subtitled in English) shown at 18.30 on the following weekday evening. An omnibus edition (also subtitled) is shown on Sunday afternoons.
The setting for the show is the (fictional) village of Cwmderi, located in the (real) Gwendraeth Valley – an area lying between Carmarthen and Llanelli in south-west Wales. By no means all of the cast speak with local, Carmarthenshire accents, however. Indeed, the fact that there are "incomers" from other Welsh-speaking parts of Wales in the village is one of the programme's features. Much of the activity centres on the village pub,</desc>

Pobol y Cwm (People of the Valley) is a Welsh-language television soap opera which has been produced by the BBC since October 1974. The longest-running television soap opera produced by the BBC, Pobol y Cwm was originally transmitted on BBC Wales television and later transferred to the Welsh-language station S4C when it opened in November 1982.
Rugby specials apart, Pobol y Cwm is consistently the most watched programme of the week on S4C, and in 1994 was briefly shown in the rest of the UK on BBC2 with English subtitles. Five episodes are produced each week, normally broadcast at 20.00 every weeknight, with a repeat (subtitled in English) shown at 18.30 on the following weekday evening. An omnibus edition (also subtitled) is shown on Sunday afternoons.
The setting for the show is the (fictional) village of Cwmderi, located in the (real) Gwendraeth Valley – an area lying between Carmarthen and Llanelli in south-west Wales. By no means all of the cast speak with local, Carmarthenshire accents, however. Indeed, the fact that there are "incomers" from other Welsh-speaking parts of Wales in the village is one of the programme's features. Much of the activity centres on the village pub,</desc>

Sgorio is a Welsh football television programme broadcast in Wales on S4C and produced by Rondo Media. The regular presenter is Nic Parry, but the programme is sometimes presented by Morgan Jones or Alun Jones. It is broadcast on Monday evenings and specialised in highlighted coverage of European football particularly in the Spanish La Liga, Italian Serie A and German Bundesliga premier leagues.
Sgorio was first aired in 1988 and for the first decade or so included Rallying and other minority sports. For the past 10 years or so however it has concentrated solely on football.
The success of Sgorio, also extended outside Wales as avid English football fans, before cable or satellite television services, attempted to pick up S4C on their aerials just so they could watch the international football games being shown on Sgorio. The popularity of the show led Channel 4 to creating their own international football show in 1992.
Sgorio regularly used the famous Italian football cultural line "Golaccio!".
On 14 December 2009, an edition of Sgorio got the lowest rating in S4C's history, when it recorded a 'zero rating' (fewer than 2,500 viewers), according to the Broadcasters Audience</desc>

Buffy the Vampire Slayer is an American television series that aired from March 10, 1997, until May 20, 2003. The series was created in 1997 by writer-director Joss Whedon under his production tag, Mutant Enemy Productions with later co-executive producers being Jane Espenson, David Fury, David Greenwalt, Doug Petrie, Marti Noxon, and David Solomon. The series narrative follows Buffy Summers (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar), the latest in a line of young women known as "Vampire Slayers" or simply "Slayers". In the story, Slayers are "called" (chosen by fate) to battle against vampires, demons, and other forces of darkness. Like previous Slayers, Buffy is aided by a Watcher, who guides, teaches, and trains her. Unlike her predecessors, Buffy surrounds herself with a circle of loyal friends who become known as the "Scooby Gang".
The series received critical and popular acclaim and usually reached between four and six million viewers on original airings. Although such ratings are lower than successful shows on the "big four" networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox), they were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB Television Network.

The Green Hornet is a television show on the ABC US television network. It aired for the 1966–1967 TV season, and starred Van Williams as the Green Hornet_Britt Reid and Bruce Lee as Kato.
The Green Hornet followed the adventures of playboy and media mogul Britt Reid, owner and publisher of the Daily Sentinel. As the masked vigilante Green Hornet, Britt fought crime with the assistance of his martial-artist partner Kato and his weapons-enhanced car the Black Beauty with license plate V-194. On police records, Green Hornet is a wanted criminal when in reality Green Hornet pretends to be a criminal in order to infiltrate and battle the criminal gangs, leaving them and the incriminating evidence for the police's arrival. Britt's dual identity is known only to his secretary Lenore "Casey" Case and District Attorney Frank P. Scanlon.
The single-season series premiered September 9, 1966, and ran through July 14, 1967, lasting 26 episodes.

The Green Hornet is a television show on the ABC US television network. It aired for the 1966–1967 TV season, and starred Van Williams as the Green Hornet_Britt Reid and Bruce Lee as Kato.
The Green Hornet followed the adventures of playboy and media mogul Britt Reid, owner and publisher of the Daily Sentinel. As the masked vigilante Green Hornet, Britt fought crime with the assistance of his martial-artist partner Kato and his weapons-enhanced car the Black Beauty with license plate V-194. On police records, Green Hornet is a wanted criminal when in reality Green Hornet pretends to be a criminal in order to infiltrate and battle the criminal gangs, leaving them and the incriminating evidence for the police's arrival. Britt's dual identity is known only to his secretary Lenore "Casey" Case and District Attorney Frank P. Scanlon.
The single-season series premiered September 9, 1966, and ran through July 14, 1967, lasting 26 episodes.

Raised on the streets of turn-of-the century London, orphaned Peter and his pals survive by their fearless wits as cunning young pickpockets. Now, they've been rounded up by their mentor Jimmy Hook to snatch a priceless, some believe, magical treasure which transports them to another world. Neverland is a realm of white jungles and legendary mysteries of eternal youth, where unknown friends and enemies snatched from time welcome the new travelers with both excitement and trepidation. These groups include a band of 18th century pirates led by the power-mad Elizabeth Bonny, and the Native American Kaw tribe led by a Holy Man, which has protected the secret of the tree spirits from Bonny and her gang for ages, and that has meant war. But as the fight to save this strange and beautiful world becomes vital, Hook, Peter, and the ragamuffin lost boys consider that growing old somewhere in time could be less important than growing up, right here in their new home called Neverland.</desc>

Freebase:
Silent Witness is a crime thriller series, produced for the BBC, focusing on a team of forensic pathology experts and their investigations into various crimes. First broadcast in 1996, and still airing as of the present day, the series was created by Nigel McCrery, a former murder squad detective based in Nottingham. He later went on to create the hit series New Tricks, with writer Roy Mitchell.
The original series was based on Professor Helen Witwell, a forensic pathologist based in Sheffield, whom McCrery had known while serving as a police officer. The programme originally followed the activities of a female pathologist, Professor Sam Ryan, played by Amanda Burton. However, Ryan's character departed early in the eighth series in 2004. There had been a succession of regular supporting characters, changing almost every series, but Dr Leo Dalton (William Gaminara) and Dr Harry Cunningham (Tom Ward), who were introduced in the sixth series in 2002, remained in the series and continued as lead characters following Ryan's departure, with Dalton replacing her as professor. A new character, Dr Nikki Alexander (Emilia Fox), was introduced to the team in the eighth series in 2004. While</desc>

Sky News at Ten is a long-running daily news show on Sky News, airing between 10:00pm and 11:00pm (including Sportsline at 10:45pm). From Monday to Thursday, the show is presented by Anna Botting whilst Friday to Sunday Mark Longhurst fronts the programme.
The show was originally launched in 1999 following the move of ITV's News at Ten. At this time, the show used its own special version of the Sky News graphics and a unique mix of the Sky News Music.
Over the years, the show has been presented by many of Sky's presenters although between 2002 and October 2005, the show had no set presenters, with a group of five or six rotating the duties. These included Chris Roberts, Vivien Creegor, Stephen Dixon, Allan King, Emma Crosby, and Martin Popplewell.
In May 2010, Sky News at Ten began to air in the United States on the Fox Soccer Channel cable network at 2am Eastern Time until the start of the European season in August, mainly because of the programme's comprehensive look at the sports of the day and to reduce conflicts with ESPN due to sister network Sky Sports News usually airing at that time. The substitution of Sky News at Ten was purposeful, as Fox Soccer Channel was disallowed</desc>

Freebase:
Brainiac: Science Abuse (often shortened to simply Brainiac) is a British entertainment TV show with a science motif. Numerous experiments are carried out in each show, often to verify whether common conceptions are true (such as whether it is possible to run across a pool of custard) or simply to create impressive explosions. The show centres on the three core branches of science for the key stages in British education: chemistry, physics and to a lesser extent, biology. The experimenters on the show are referred to as "Brainiacs", and each episode usually finishes with the destruction of a caravan.
The show is produced by ITV umbrella studios Granada Productions (collaboration between London Weekend Television and Granada Television in Manchester) and is broadcast in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland on Sky Digital.
The original presenters were Richard Hammond and Jon Tickle, then joined in the second series by Charlotte Hudson. Hammond left after the fourth, and was replaced by Vic Reeves and Hudson left after the fifth, and was replaced by Thaila Zucchi. The show's fifth series first aired on 8 May 2007 and the sixth, on 13 January 2008.

Dog the Bounty Hunter is a reality television show on A&amp;E which chronicles Duane "Dog" Chapman's adventures as a fugitive recovery agent, or bounty hunter. With a few exceptions, the show takes place in Hawaii or Dog's home state of Colorado.
After eight seasons, on May 21, 2012 A&amp;E cancelled the series.
Duane "Dog" Chapman is joined by his business partner and wife, Beth Chapman; his grown sons Duane Lee Chapman, II and Leland Chapman, and his "brother," Tim "Youngblood" Chapman (despite having the same last name, Chapman and Tim are not biologically related). In Season 2, Dog's teenage daughter, "Baby" Lyssa Chapman returns home and becomes a member of the bounty-hunting team. Justin Bihag (son of longtime family friend Moon Bihag) also helps out during Season 1 and occasionally later.
The program spun off from Chapman's appearance on the show Take This Job, a program about people with unusual occupations. Both shows are produced for A&amp;E by Hybrid Films, a New York-based production company. Dog the Bounty Hunter captured an audience immediately by drawing viewers into the interaction of Chapman and his family_team, mixing street smarts, romance, arguments, teamwork,</desc>

Futurama is an American animated science fiction comedy sitcom created by Matt Groening and developed by Groening and David X. Cohen for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series follows the adventures of a late-20th-century New York City pizza delivery boy, Philip J. Fry, who, after being unwittingly cryogenically frozen for one thousand years, finds employment at Planet Express, an interplanetary delivery company in the retro-futuristic 31st century. The series was envisioned by Groening in the late 1990s while working on The Simpsons, later bringing Cohen aboard to develop storylines and characters to pitch the show to Fox.
In the United States, the series aired on Fox from March 28, 1999 to August 10, 2003 before ceasing production. Futurama was then aired in reruns on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim from 2003 to 2007, until the network's contract expired. It was revived in 2007 as four direct-to-video films; the last of the four was released in early 2009. Comedy Central entered into an agreement with 20th Century Fox Television to syndicate the existing episodes and air the films as 16 new, half-hour episodes.

Switchback was a Canadian television show for children and teens broadcast on CBC Television in the 1980s. It was produced regionally from Vancouver, Winnipeg, Regina, Halifax, Calgary and Toronto.
Produced by Nijole Kuzmickas and originally hosted by Canadian folk musician Rick Scott, CBC Vancouver's Switchback was a weekly Sunday morning live broadcast that began in January 1981. The name "Switchback" referred to the program's original format, which invited young viewers to trade used toys, comic books, and other bric-a-brac. Viewers could either call in or write in with offers, which were written on a board on the studio set or later featured in a free classified-ad-style publication put together by the show and mailed out to viewers who requested it. This feature was dropped after the first season. The show regularly featured phone-in contests and write-in raffles for prizes such as T-shirts, LPs and toys. An old cowboy cliff-hanger adventure serial was also featured weekly during the first season. The second season began with host Gordon White, soon replaced by Richard Newman (now a voice actor), who remained with the show for two and a half years.

Road Wars is a reality television programme created by Raw Cut TV for British Sky Broadcasting and broadcast on Sky1, Sky2 and Pick TV, and also worldwide. Since Series 1 the show was narrated by Lee Boardman who played villain Jez Quigley in ITV soap Coronation Street. The 2nd half of series 7 was narrated by Claire Goose who played Inspector Rachel Weston in ITV1 police drama The Bill, The reason was unknown.
Road Wars is unlike other previous police programmes on Sky in that it followed the work of officers rather than simply playing police video clips. The programme has documented the changing tactics of criminals, perhaps most importantly their increasing violence and recklessness, and the response of the UK police forces. The programme also features some police videos from America.
For series 1-6, the programme followed the fourteen members of the Thames Valley Police's roads policing proactive unit (Road Crime Unit) - known as "Tango Victor". They are also said to be known to fellow officers as "Tango Vulture", taken from their callsign prefix TV (Tango Victor) and the joke that they swoop to steal arrests from other officers while they carried out their duties.

Ford Monday Night Football (MNF) is a football programme on Sky Sports which broadcasts live English football generally from the Premier League.
Sky television's acquisition of rights to broadcast live Premier League football from the start of the 1992–93 season saw them attempt innovations such as digital on-screen graphics (DOG) and Monday Night live games. The first Monday Night Football game was between Manchester City and Queens Park Rangers on 17 August 1992. To give the broadcasts a different look to the Ford Super Sunday broadcast Sky introduced the Sky Strikers, a dance troupe similar to American cheerleaders. This pre-match and half-time entertainment was dropped after the first season.
The show had a number of different formats after its launch. The first change led to the merging of Andy Gray's Boot Room format into the show; analysing the previous weekends football matches utilising the latest computer technology combined with analyses from Andy himself.

The show originally debuted in the United States on the UPN television network on April 29, 1999, but after the merger of UPN and the WB, SmackDown began airing on The CW in 2006. The show remained on the CW network for two years until it was announced that it would move to MyNetworkTV in October 2008. SmackDown moved to Syfy on October 1, 2010.
Due to time differences, SmackDown premieres a few hours earlier in Ireland and UK and a day earlier in Australia, Singapore, and Philippines than the United States. For international broadcast listings, see below.
The early set featured an oval-shaped TitanTron entrance and stage (dubbed the "OvalTron") which made it stand out from the Raw set with its rectangular TitanTrons. Later</desc>

Stargate SG-1 (often abbreviated as SG-1) is a Canadian-American adventure and military science fiction television series and part of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's Stargate franchise. The show, created by Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner, is based on the 1994 feature film Stargate by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich. The television series was filmed in and around the city of Vancouver, Canada. In the United States, Showtime broadcast the first five seasons, from 1997 to 2002, and then the series moved to the Sci Fi Channel for its last five seasons, from 2002 to 2007. The final episode premiered on Sky1 in the United Kingdom on March 13, 2007, three months before its United States premiere. With ten seasons and 214 episodes, Stargate SG-1 surpassed The X-Files in 2007 as the longest-running North American science fiction series on television, before being surpassed by Smallville in 2011 with 218 episodes in ten seasons.
The story of Stargate SG-1 begins about a year after the events of the feature film, when the United States government learns that a network of ancient alien devices called Stargates connects a vast multitude of planets within our Milky Way galaxy, facilitating</desc>

Charmed is an American television series that originally aired from October 7, 1998, until May 21, 2006, on the now defunct The WB Television Network. The series was created by writer Constance M. Burge and was produced by Aaron Spelling and his Spelling Television company, with the show runner being writer-director Brad Kern.
The series follows the four Halliwell sisters—Prue, Piper, Phoebe and, later on in the series, Paige (who replaces Prue from season 4 onwards). The sisters are the culmination of the most powerful line of good witches in history and are known as The Charmed Ones in the supernatural community, whose prophesized destiny is to protect innocent lives against evil beings such as demons and warlocks. Each sister possesses unique magical powers that grow and evolve, while they attempt to hold normal working lives in modern day San Francisco. Keeping their supernatural identities separate and secret from their ordinary lives often becomes a challenge for them, with the exposure of magic having far-reaching consequences on their various relationships and resulting in a number of police and FBI investigations throughout the series.

Dog the Bounty Hunter is a reality television show on A&amp;E which chronicles Duane "Dog" Chapman's adventures as a fugitive recovery agent, or bounty hunter. With a few exceptions, the show takes place in Hawaii or Dog's home state of Colorado.
After eight seasons, on May 21, 2012 A&amp;E cancelled the series.
Duane "Dog" Chapman is joined by his business partner and wife, Beth Chapman; his grown sons Duane Lee Chapman, II and Leland Chapman, and his "brother," Tim "Youngblood" Chapman (despite having the same last name, Chapman and Tim are not biologically related). In Season 2, Dog's teenage daughter, "Baby" Lyssa Chapman returns home and becomes a member of the bounty-hunting team. Justin Bihag (son of longtime family friend Moon Bihag) also helps out during Season 1 and occasionally later.
The program spun off from Chapman's appearance on the show Take This Job, a program about people with unusual occupations. Both shows are produced for A&amp;E by Hybrid Films, a New York-based production company. Dog the Bounty Hunter captured an audience immediately by drawing viewers into the interaction of Chapman and his family_team, mixing street smarts, romance, arguments, teamwork,</desc>

Road Wars is a reality television programme created by Raw Cut TV for British Sky Broadcasting and broadcast on Sky1, Sky2 and Pick TV, and also worldwide. Since Series 1 the show was narrated by Lee Boardman who played villain Jez Quigley in ITV soap Coronation Street. The 2nd half of series 7 was narrated by Claire Goose who played Inspector Rachel Weston in ITV1 police drama The Bill, The reason was unknown.
Road Wars is unlike other previous police programmes on Sky in that it followed the work of officers rather than simply playing police video clips. The programme has documented the changing tactics of criminals, perhaps most importantly their increasing violence and recklessness, and the response of the UK police forces. The programme also features some police videos from America.
For series 1-6, the programme followed the fourteen members of the Thames Valley Police's roads policing proactive unit (Road Crime Unit) - known as "Tango Victor". They are also said to be known to fellow officers as "Tango Vulture", taken from their callsign prefix TV (Tango Victor) and the joke that they swoop to steal arrests from other officers while they carried out their duties.

Sexcetera is an American Playboy TV newsmagazine focused on human sexuality.
Having run over 80 episodes, since its launch in 1998, it is one of Playboy's longest-running series. Sexcetera features four to five "reports" per 1-hour episode.
The reports, which were filmed throughout the United States and in Europe, generally covered fetishes, adult expos or gatherings, current erotic trends, sex products (e.g. toys), pornographic celebrities, and tips for couples. Reporters presented their stories in a humorous style, and female correspondents often got naked during their own pieces.
Though no longer in production, reruns are still shown on Playboy TV, Sky Living and Pick TV. The network's current shows 69 Sexy Things 2 Do Before You Die and e-Rotic are built much around the same premise as the original Sexcetera.

For the second season, formerly recurring cast members Mike O'Malley, Heather Morris and Naya Rivera were promoted to the main cast.

The series was created by Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan, the last of whom first conceived of Glee as a film. The three wrote all of the show's episodes for the first two</desc>

Fringe is an American science fiction television series created by J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci. It premiered on the Fox Broadcasting network on September 9, 2008. The series follows Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), and Walter Bishop (John Noble), members of a Federal Bureau of Investigation "Fringe Division" team based in Boston, Massachusetts under the supervision of Homeland Security. The team uses "fringe" science and FBI investigative techniques to investigate a series of unexplained, often ghastly occurrences, which are related to mysteries surrounding a parallel universe. The series has been described as a hybrid of The X-Files, Altered States and The Twilight Zone.
The series' format combines elements from procedural dramas as well as those found in serials. The series began as a more traditional "mystery of the week" series, and became more serialized in later seasons. A majority of episodes contain a standalone plot, with several episodes also exploring the series' overarching mythology.
Early critical reception of the first season was lukewarm, but became more of a critic favorite in subsequent seasons when the series began to</desc>

SpongeBob SquarePants (often referred to simply as SpongeBob) is an American animated television series, created by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg. Much of the series centers on the exploits and adventures of the title character and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. The series' popularity has prompted the release of a media franchise, contributing to its position as Nickelodeon's highest rated show, the most distributed property of MTV Networks, and among Nicktoons' most watched shows. It is listed 15th in IGN's top 100 animated series list.
When Rocko's Modern Life ended in 1996, Hillenburg began working on SpongeBob SquarePants. He teamed up with several Nickelodeon veterans and Rocko crew members, including creative director Derek Drymon (Action League Now!, Hey Arnold!, and Rocko's Modern Life) writers and directors Sherm Cohen, and Dan Povenmire, writer Tim Hill, actor and writer Martin Olson, animation director Alan Smart (all from Rocko's Modern Life), and story editor Merriwether Williams (The Angry Beavers), who worked on the series for its first few seasons and switched to SpongeBob SquarePants in July 1999.

SpongeBob SquarePants (often referred to simply as SpongeBob) is an American animated television series, created by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg. Much of the series centers on the exploits and adventures of the title character and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. The series' popularity has prompted the release of a media franchise, contributing to its position as Nickelodeon's highest rated show, the most distributed property of MTV Networks, and among Nicktoons' most watched shows. It is listed 15th in IGN's top 100 animated series list.
When Rocko's Modern Life ended in 1996, Hillenburg began working on SpongeBob SquarePants. He teamed up with several Nickelodeon veterans and Rocko crew members, including creative director Derek Drymon (Action League Now!, Hey Arnold!, and Rocko's Modern Life) writers and directors Sherm Cohen, and Dan Povenmire, writer Tim Hill, actor and writer Martin Olson, animation director Alan Smart (all from Rocko's Modern Life), and story editor Merriwether Williams (The Angry Beavers), who worked on the series for its first few seasons and switched to SpongeBob SquarePants in July 1999.

Punk'd is an American hidden camera-practical joke reality television series that first aired on MTV in 2003 and was created by Ashton Kutcher and Jason Goldberg, and produced and hosted by Ashton Kutcher. It bore a resemblance to both the classic hidden camera show Candid Camera and to TV's Bloopers &amp; Practical Jokes, which also featured pranks on celebrities. Being "punk'd" referred to being the victim of such a prank.
The series finale aired on MTV on May 29, 2007. The series culminated in early June with the Punk'd Awards.
After a five-year hiatus, the series was revived with a March 29, 2012 premiere. The revived series will be hosted by different celebrity guests each week.
Originally, Ashton Kutcher and MTV were developing a series called Harassment, a hidden camera show which would feature pranks on regular people. However, a January 2002 prank involving a fake dead body at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas backfired and the couple who were targets of the prank sued Kutcher, MTV and the hotel for $10 million.

South Park is an American animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone for the Comedy Central television network. Intended for mature audiences, the show has become famous for its crude language and dark, surreal humor that lampoons a wide range of topics. The ongoing narrative revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick—and their bizarre adventures in and around the titular Colorado town.
Parker and Stone, who met at college, developed the show from two animated shorts they created in 1992 and 1995. The latter became one of the first Internet viral videos, which ultimately led to its production as a series. South Park debuted in August 1997 with great success, consistently earning the highest ratings of any basic cable program. Subsequent ratings have varied but it remains one of Comedy Central's highest rated shows. It is Comedy Central's longest running program; a total of 230 episodes have aired, and the series is slated to run through at least 2016.

The Liver Birds is a British situation comedy, set in Liverpool, Merseyside, North-West of England, which aired on BBC1 from 1969 to 1978, and again in 1996. It was created by Carla Lane and Myra Taylor. The two Liverpudlian housewives had met at a local writers club and decided to pool their talents. Having been invited to London by Michael Mills (BBC Head of Comedy) and asked to write about two women sharing a flat, Mills brought in sitcom expert Sydney Lotterby to work with the writing team. Lotterby had previously worked with Eric Sykes, Sheila Hancock and on The Likely Lads. Carla Lane in fact wrote most of the episodes, Taylor co-writing only the first two series. The pilot was shown as an episode of Comedy Playhouse, the BBC's breeding ground for sitcoms, in April 1969.
The series charted the ups and downs of two 'dolly birds' sharing a flat on Huskisson Street, in Liverpool. The series concentrated on the problems encountered by the two young single women when dealing with boyfriends, work, parents and each other. Dressed in the best 1970s fashions they looked for romance in a loose female equivalent of The Likely Lads.

2point4 Children is a 1990s British sitcom that was created and written by Andrew Marshall. It follows the lives of the Porter family; an average family that is persistently faced with surreal situations and sheer bad luck.
The show was originally broadcast on BBC1 from 1991 to 1999, and ran for eight series, ending in a special Millennium edition that would be the last due to the death of Gary Olsen, who died from cancer in 2000. The show is now repeated regularly in the UK on G.O.L.D., and in Australia on UKTV.
The title of the show refers to the once average size of a UK family. There are two children in the Porter family, however Andrew Marshall has indicated that the father, Ben, could be considered almost another child, making up the "point four".
The show regularly picked up large audiences of up to 13 million in the 1990s, and the final episode was viewed by 9.03 million people.
In 1997 a remake of the show debuted in the Netherlands: 'Kees &amp; Co' starring Simone Kleinsma.

Waiting for God is a British sitcom that ran on BBC1 for five series from 1990 to 1994. It starred Stephanie Cole and Graham Crowden as two spirited residents of a retirement home who spend their time running rings around the home's oppressive management and their own families. It was written by Michael Aitkens.
The programme is still repeated in the UK on various channels. Seasons 1 through 5 have run (and in some cases continue to run) on PBS in the United States, and in New Zealand the show has aired various times since 2002.
Diana Trent (Stephanie Cole) - Diana is a curmudgeonly old woman who is constantly complaining about the state of the world. She is an atheist and often irritates Tom, who does believe in God. Trent used to be a photojournalist, specialising in combat zones.
Tom Ballard (Graham Crowden) - Tom is an optimistic, jolly old man who is new to the home. He suffers from mild dementia but he always tries to make the best of things. Sometimes, however, he goes against certain people such as Harvey Bains, who he often campaigns against and insults.

Freebase:
Keeping Up Appearances is a British sitcom created and written by Roy Clarke for the BBC. Centred on the life of eccentric, social-climbing snob Hyacinth Bucket (who insists that her surname is pronounced Bouquet), the sitcom portrays a social hierarchy-ruled British society. It jokes about a small obsessive world where a determined snobbish middle class woman desperately and continually looks for opportunities to climb the social ladder, despite being wedged between a working class background and upper class aspirations.
The show stars Patricia Routledge as Hyacinth Bucket, the pompous and self-serving central woman obsessed by perfection, image and etiquette, and also includes performances from Clive Swift as her calm, tolerant and long-suffering husband, Richard Bucket, and Josephine Tewson as her neighbour Elizabeth, a friendly pushover who is continually fearful of Hyacinth's presence. In Series Two Elizabeth's recently divorced brother Emmett (David Griffin) moves in with her. Judy Cornwell, Geoffrey Hughes and Mary Millar play Hyacinth's relatives, Daisy, Onslow her husband, and Rose, whose working-class presence she is continually fearful of.

Freebase:
2point4 Children is a 1990s British sitcom that was created and written by Andrew Marshall. It follows the lives of the Porter family; an average family that is persistently faced with surreal situations and sheer bad luck.
The show was originally broadcast on BBC1 from 1991 to 1999, and ran for eight series, ending in a special Millennium edition that would be the last due to the death of Gary Olsen, who died from cancer in 2000. The show is now repeated regularly in the UK on G.O.L.D., and in Australia on UKTV.
The title of the show refers to the once average size of a UK family. There are two children in the Porter family, however Andrew Marshall has indicated that the father, Ben, could be considered almost another child, making up the "point four".
The show regularly picked up large audiences of up to 13 million in the 1990s, and the final episode was viewed by 9.03 million people.
In 1997 a remake of the show debuted in the Netherlands: 'Kees &amp; Co' starring Simone Kleinsma.

Waiting for God is a British sitcom that ran on BBC1 for five series from 1990 to 1994. It starred Stephanie Cole and Graham Crowden as two spirited residents of a retirement home who spend their time running rings around the home's oppressive management and their own families. It was written by Michael Aitkens.
The programme is still repeated in the UK on various channels. Seasons 1 through 5 have run (and in some cases continue to run) on PBS in the United States, and in New Zealand the show has aired various times since 2002.
Diana Trent (Stephanie Cole) - Diana is a curmudgeonly old woman who is constantly complaining about the state of the world. She is an atheist and often irritates Tom, who does believe in God. Trent used to be a photojournalist, specialising in combat zones.
Tom Ballard (Graham Crowden) - Tom is an optimistic, jolly old man who is new to the home. He suffers from mild dementia but he always tries to make the best of things. Sometimes, however, he goes against certain people such as Harvey Bains, who he often campaigns against and insults. He is visited often by his 'dull' son Geoffrey and Geoffrey's annoying, offensive wife Marion.

In 2004, the series was voted eighth in Britain's Best Sitcom.
The series features a small grocer's shop in Balby, a suburb of Doncaster in South Yorkshire. The owner, Albert Arkwright (Ronnie Barker), is a middle-aged miser with a stammer and a knack for being able to sell anything to any buyer, no matter how unwilling. His nephew Granville (David Jason), is his put-upon errand boy, whose attempts at a love-life or even just a meaningful social life fall flat. He blames his uncle, in particular, that, he has to be up early to open the shop, stay up late to close it with only an odd hour of free time and deliver large numbers of goods on a battered bicycle. Almost every mistake Arkwright makes is followed by a cry of "Gr-Granville! F-fetch yer cloth!".

Freebase:
The Liver Birds is a British situation comedy, set in Liverpool, Merseyside, North-West of England, which aired on BBC1 from 1969 to 1978, and again in 1996. It was created by Carla Lane and Myra Taylor. The two Liverpudlian housewives had met at a local writers club and decided to pool their talents. Having been invited to London by Michael Mills (BBC Head of Comedy) and asked to write about two women sharing a flat, Mills brought in sitcom expert Sydney Lotterby to work with the writing team. Lotterby had previously worked with Eric Sykes, Sheila Hancock and on The Likely Lads. Carla Lane in fact wrote most of the episodes, Taylor co-writing only the first two series. The pilot was shown as an episode of Comedy Playhouse, the BBC's breeding ground for sitcoms, in April 1969.
The series charted the ups and downs of two 'dolly birds' sharing a flat on Huskisson Street, in Liverpool. The series concentrated on the problems encountered by the two young single women when dealing with boyfriends, work, parents and each other. Dressed in the best 1970s fashions they looked for romance in a loose female equivalent of The Likely Lads.
The pilot and Series 1 starred Pauline Collins as Dawn</desc>

The pilot was shown as an episode of Comedy Playhouse, the BBC's breeding ground for sitcoms, in April 1969.
The series charted the ups and downs of two 'dolly birds' sharing a flat on Huskisson Street, in Liverpool. The series concentrated on the problems encountered by the two young single women when dealing with boyfriends, work, parents and each other. Dressed in the best 1970s fashions they looked for romance in a loose female equivalent of The Likely Lads.
The pilot and Series 1 starred Pauline Collins as Dawn</desc>

Cash in the Attic, also Cash in the Celebrity Attic, is a UK television show on the BBC. The show, made by Leopard Films, premièred in 2002 and has run for sixteen series; as of February 2010, the seventeenth series is currently in production, along with the fifth celebrity series. The programme's tagline is The show that helps you find hidden treasures in your home, and then sells them for you at auction.
In the show, the presenter visits a family's house to find out what they need to raise money for. They then explore the house and its surroundings, finding antiques and valuing them, with the help of experts. The family then goes to auction with the aim of making their financial target. The auction never takes place on the same day as the rummage; often it can take place several weeks later.
In celebrity episodes, the well-known guest contributors rummage around their homes for antiques to be valued and sold at auction. The celebrity donates the proceeds to his or her charity of choice. As of February 2010, 86 episodes have been made and a total of £91,266 has been raised for charities in the UK and abroad.
As of March 2010, the show is hosted by Angela Rippon, Jennie Bond,</desc>

Doctor Who is a British science fiction television programme produced by the BBC. The programme depicts the adventures of a Time Lord—a time travelling, humanoid alien with two hearts known as the Doctor. He explores the universe in his TARDIS—a sentient, telepathic time machine that flies through time and space. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, a common sight in 1963, when the series first aired. Along with a succession of companions, the Doctor faces a variety of foes while working to save civilisations, help ordinary people, and right wrongs.
The show has received recognition from critics and the public as one of the finest British television programmes, including the 2006 British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series and five consecutive (2005–10) wins at the National Television Awards under Russell T Davies' reign as Executive Producer. In 2011, Matt Smith became the first Doctor to be nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.

The Bill is a police procedural television series that was broadcast on the ITV network from October 16, 1984 until August 31, 2010. The programme originated from a one-off drama, entitled Woodentop, which was broadcast in August 1983. In its final year on air, The Bill was broadcast once a week, usually on Tuesdays or Thursdays, in a one-hour format. The programme focused on the lives and work of one shift of police officers, rather than on any particular aspect of police work. At the time of the series' conclusion, The Bill was the longest-running police procedural television series in the United Kingdom, and was among the longest-running of any British television series. The series was produced by Thames Television. The series name originated from "Old Bill", a slang term for the police. It was also Geoff McQueen's original title idea for the series, before he eventually decided on "The Bill".
Although highly acclaimed amongst fans and critics alike, the series attracted controversy on several occasions. Am episode broadcast in 2008 was criticised for featuring fictional treatment for multiple sclerosis, and another episode in the same year resulted in litigation, submitted by</desc>

Primeval: New World is a forthcoming Canadian science fiction television programme, set in Vancouver, British Columbia, created by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens. A co-production between Impossible Pictures and Omni Film Productions for Space, the show is a spin-off of the British series Primeval. It will be broadcast in the United Kingdom on Watch, and on Space in Canada. As with Primeval, the premise of Primeval: New World involves a team of scientists who have to deal with animals from the past and future that travel through time to the present day through anomalies. The tone of the series will be "older, darker and scarier" than the original.
In the Primeval universe, animals from the past and future travel through time to present day Britain through anomalies, fictional phenomena which act as portals through time. A team of government scientists attempts to covertly capture the animals and return them to their home geologic eras while preventing the public from becoming aware of the existence of the anomalies. In Primeval: New World, set in Vancouver, British Columbia, a team of scientists investigate the opening of anomalies in northern latitudes.

Grimm is an American police procedural fantasy television drama series. It debuted in the U.S. on NBC on October 28, 2011. In Canada, it airs on CTV and—in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere in the Americas—on such networks as Universal Channel and Watch. The show has been described as "a cop drama—with a twist... a dark and fantastical project about a world in which characters inspired by Grimms' Fairy Tales exist", although the stories and characters inspiring the show are also drawn from other sources.
Homicide Detective Nick Burkhardt of the Portland Police Bureau learns he is descended from a line of "guardians" known as "Grimms," charged with keeping balance between humanity and the mythological creatures (called "Wesen" however use of Germanic pronunciation renders it sounding like "Vessin") of the world. Throughout the episodes, he must battle against an assortment of dangerous creatures, with help from his friend Monroe (who is a reformed creature), and his partner Detective Hank Griffin.
Many of the episodes are loosely based on stories written by the Brothers Grimm, albeit with considerable artistic license. Other episodes are based on other sources, including fables and</desc>

Hollywood Treasure is a weekly, American, reality television series that began airing on SyFy, October 27, 2010, which follows a Hollywood, California-based appraiser named Joe Maddalena and his team as they track down, appraise and help auction off valuable film, television and pop culture memorabilia.
David Hinckley of the New York Daily News says, "Hollywood Treasure will intrigue film junkies and memorabilia collectors. For the rest of us, it's breezy amusement about a world that, like the movies themselves, we will always be watching from the audience."
To Brian Lowry of Variety, "It's just that we've seen this movie (or rather, reality-TV show) before, dozens of times, in more glamorous settings. And having each half-hour (two will air back to back) conclude with an auction doesn't really foster much suspense."

Homes Under the Hammer is a BBC One morning television series, which has been running since 2003. Its main presenters are Lucy Alexander and Martin Roberts, although in series three Marc Woodward and Jasmine Birtles alternated presenting duties with Alexander and Roberts. The series is the BBC's most successful show that has been shown in the 10.00am slot, regularly attaining a 30% share for new episodes.
Each episode of the show follows three properties (or two for 30-minute shows) which were bought at auction - often ones that require significant refurbishment. A cross-section of properties are featured including terraced, commercial, rural, and vacant land. The programme follows a set formula. One of the presenters will view the property prior to going up for auction giving their opinion on it and its potential problems as well as attractive features. A local estate agent will also be invited to give their opinion on the property. The auction will then be shown and the final sale price revealed.

Doctors is produced by BBC Birmingham and is screened on BBC One, with the first episode broadcast on 26 March 2000. It was created by Chris Murray, with Mal Young developing it and Carson Black the original producer. The show has been shown at lunchtime since its inception, originally at 12.30pm as a lead-in to the BBC's One O'Clock News. After it was temporarily moved to allow for extended news coverage of the September 11th 2001 attacks, its regular slot changed to 2:10 pm, following directly after Neighbours, after ratings rose to a 25% audience share. When the BBC lost Neighbours to Channel 5 in January 2008, it moved into the Australian soap's old slot of 1:45pm.

Perfection is a game show shown on BBC Two, hosted by Nick Knowles. It was first broadcast on 17 January 2011.
Four players, referred to by the host as the "Usual Suspects", compete. One contestant is chosen at random from the four to compete in the main game on stage, while the other three play against the contestant from their soundproof booth. In each of the three initial rounds of the game, the host starts by turning off the booth, so the Usual Suspects can neither hear nor see anything happening on stage. The contestant is then given four true-or-false statements to answer in 45 seconds. Once all four answers have been locked in, the booth is turned back on so the Usual Suspects can see the contestant's answers.
The host then reveals how many answers the contestant got right, but not which specific ones. If all four are correct, the contestant wins the round immediately. If the contestant got less than four correct, the Usual Suspects have the chance to change the contestant's answers, with the knowledge of how many he_she got wrong.

Similar to Family Fortunes, contestants must give answers to a question which had previously been asked to one hundred members of the public. However, there are important differences:
The object of the game is to score as few points as possible by giving correct answers that the public have or have not given, ultimately scoring lower than other contestants. The contestants particularly try to look for answers that score no points, which are known as "Pointless" answers. Finding a Pointless Answer adds £250 to the jackpot in rounds prior to the Final, and finding a Pointless Answer in the Final wins the game.
At the beginning of the show there are four teams (five in the first series) of two players. Any team which does not reach the final of the show on their first appearance is invited back for a second (and final) appearance on the next show.
The aim of the show is to get as few points as possible, by answering questions with lesser known correct answers.

Homes Under the Hammer is a BBC One morning television series, which has been running since 2003. Its main presenters are Lucy Alexander and Martin Roberts, although in series three Marc Woodward and Jasmine Birtles alternated presenting duties with Alexander and Roberts. The series is the BBC's most successful show that has been shown in the 10.00am slot, regularly attaining a 30% share for new episodes.
Each episode of the show follows three properties (or two for 30-minute shows) which were bought at auction - often ones that require significant refurbishment. A cross-section of properties are featured including terraced, commercial, rural, and vacant land. The programme follows a set formula. One of the presenters will view the property prior to going up for auction giving their opinion on it and its potential problems as well as attractive features. A local estate agent will also be invited to give their opinion on the property. The auction will then be shown and the final sale price revealed.
It is at this point we first meet the new buyer, and Martin or Lucy will interview them and find out their background, why they bought the property, whether they are happy with it given</desc>

Don't Get Done, Get Dom is a British reality television series which helps consumers get good deals when purchasing goods. The show lends its name from its presenter Dominic Littlewood. It is aired on BBC One and repeated on BBC Two in the UK.
Series one was first aired in June 2006 and a second series was later commissioned and began to air in June 2007. Series three began in June 2008. Series four aired for two weeks on BBC in late May to early June 2010. Series five began on 25 April 2011. Series six was shown from 9–27 April 2012.
During the show, a member of the public is "tutored" into getting a better deal on a product which they are attempting to buy; typically giving them more confidence in talking to and making deals with the store assistants and managers. Examples from the series are people purchasing video cameras and sports gear.
This is achieved by Littlewood seeing camera footage of a first attempt, and giving them pointers. After this they try another shop but this time Littlewood can communicate to the member of the public by means of a hidden earpiece.

See Hear was launched on BBC2 on 11 October 1981. It was broadcast with open subtitles, and was presented in sign by Martin Colville, a hearing CODA, and a Deaf presenter Maggie Woolley. The programme was originally broadcast on Sunday afternoons during lunchtime. As the series went from strength to strength different topics, such as discussions, chat shows, and special editions focussing on technology and education for Deaf people were added that ran alongside the original magazine.

For the 2008 series, Jeremy Vine was brought in to present on nights when Murnaghan was hosting the spinoff series Are You an Egghead? This happened again from October 2009 while Murnaghan presented the second series of the spinoff show. Since the spin-off show finished, Jeremy Vine has continued to host the second half of each series, which broadcasts 52 weeks a year.

It is normally shown weekdays every week.
The title sequence consists of a voiceover by the host stating 'These people are amongst the greatest quiz players in Britain.

Great British Railway Journeys is a BBC travel documentary television series presented by Michael Portillo. The first series premiered on 4 January 2010 on BBC Two, running for 20 half-hour episodes; two further seasons followed in 2011 and in 2012, but with each season extended from 20 to 25 episodes; a fourth season is being filmed for release in early 2013. In the series, Portillo travels around the British railway network, guided by a Victorian guidebook written by George Bradshaw, and compares how the destinations have changed in Victorian and modern times.
Travelling around Great Britain by train, Portillo uses a copy of Victorian cartographer George Bradshaw's Railway Companion to compare and contrast modern Britain with that documented by Bradshaw in the 1840s, visiting recommended points of interest which would have been of interest to the Victorians. George Bradshaw was a cartographer who in 1840 became the first person to produce a comprehensive timetable and travel guide of the railway system in Great Britain, which at the time although extensive, still comprised a series of fragmented and competing railway companies and lines each publishing their own literature.

Funny Business is a documentary style television series about the craft of comedy consisting of six 50-minute episodes. The first episode aired in the UK 22 November 1992.

It was produced by Tiger Television Productions.
The show featured appearances by many comedians, including Rowan Atkinson who made an appearance both as the presenter_narrator, and as an aspiring comedy actor named Kevin. Atkinson demonstrated many of the principles of comedy (slapstick, mime, etc.) in a manner which was instantly identifiable to anyone familiar with his Mr. Bean character.
In this episode, it is claimed that the three principal mechanics behind (visual) comedy are for an object or person to
The documentary then goes on to show these mechanics at work in different embodiments, each time illustrated with examples of mostly early visual comedy.

The first main presenter was Verity Sharp, though she shared presenting duties in the show's first run with Kwame Kwei-Armah and Andrew Graham-Dixon.

Newsnight is a BBC Television current affairs programme noted for its in-depth analysis and often robust cross-examination of senior politicians. Jeremy Paxman has been its main presenter for over two decades.
Several of the programme's editors over the years have gone on to senior positions within the BBC and elsewhere. Paxman's fellow presenters are Gavin Esler, Kirsty Wark and Emily Maitlis. Newsnight has been broadcast on BBC Two since 1980. It goes out on weekday evenings between 10:30pm and 11:20pm. Occasionally it may have an extended edition if there is an especially eventful event in the news - as happened on July 7 2011, when closure of the News of the World led to an extended version which went on until 11:35 pm. Recordings are available within the UK via the BBC website. A weekly 26-minute digest edition of Newsnight is screened on the corporation's international channel, BBC World News.
Newsnight in its current format began on 30 January 1980, although a shorter news bulletin of the same name had run in its late-night BBC2 slot during the 1970s. Its launch was delayed for four months by the Association of Broadcasting Staff, at the time the main BBC trade union.</desc>

See Hear is a weekly magazine programme for deaf and hard of hearing people in the UK, broadcast on Wednesday afternoons at 1pm. The programme focuses on the British and the worldwide deaf community and covers a broad range of topics from areas such as education, deaf people's rights, technology and language. A regular segment is given over to Deaf News, which is presented by Tessa Padden. The programme is presented entirely in BSL and is broadcast with voice-over and subtitles in English throughout the programme.
See Hear was launched on BBC2 on 11 October 1981. It was broadcast with open subtitles, and was presented in sign by Martin Colville, a hearing CODA, and a Deaf presenter Maggie Woolley. The programme was originally broadcast on Sunday afternoons during lunchtime. As the series went from strength to strength different topics, such as discussions, chat shows, and special editions focussing on technology and education for Deaf people were added that ran alongside the original magazine.
Over the years See Hear's appeal within the Deaf community increased, and with it the involvement of Clive Mason, the series' longest serving presenter who joined in 1984. Clive was</desc>

The Hoobs is a BAFTA-winning children's television programme created and produced by The Jim Henson Company.
In the United Kingdom, it is a regular feature in early morning schedules. The show is made in the UK, as are many other Jim Henson Company productions. It was commissioned for Channel 4, and was shown at around the times of 6:00am to 7:00am regularly since January 2001, when the show started. It has also been shown for other countries, including North America (repeats formerly airing on PBS Kids Sprout).
It stars five creatures called Hoobs (Hubba Hubba, Iver, Groove, Tula, and Roma) from the fictional Hoobland, and their interactions with Earth and the human race. In each episode, they try to find the answer to a question to be put in the great Hoobopaedia created by Hubba Hubba, back in Hoobland, in hopes of learning all there is to know. Hubba Hubba remains in Hoobland to await the report from the other Hoobs; Iver, Groove, and Tula live in the Hoobmobile; and Roma travels to all parts of the world. The five creatures are puppets, but the show also includes some animated sequences as well as live motion of human children who explain concepts to the Hoobs.

According to Jim is an American sitcom television series starring Jim Belushi in the title role as a suburban father of three children. It originally ran on ABC from October 3, 2001 to June 2, 2009.
Jim is an abrasive but lovable suburban father. Much like his real life counterpart, Jim's character is noted as a fan of blues music, as well as the Chicago Bears, Chicago Cubs, Chicago Bulls and the Chicago Blackhawks. Together with his wife Cheryl, whose middle name is Mabel, they have three children, daughters Ruby and Gracie and son Kyle. In the seventh season they become parents of a pair of twins Jonathan and Gordon.
Jim often finds himself in messy situations because his laziness inclines him to search for alternative ways of doing things with least effort. While Cheryl's brother Andy may be Jim's best friend, her sister Dana frequently teams up with Cheryl against Jim. He also prefers to lie to Cheryl and Dana to do his own activities but they end up backfiring on him. He hates losing to women (e.g. Hot Dog Eating Contests, Hamburger Eating Contests, Pizza Eating Contests, Pot Pie Eating Contests), especially if Cheryl or Dana find out.

The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series is a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle epitomized by its family of the same name, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture, society, television and many aspects of the human condition.
The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox, becoming the network's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989–1990).
Since its debut on December 17, 1989, the show has broadcast 508 episodes and the twenty-third season started airing on September 25, 2011. The Simpsons is the longest-running American sitcom, the longest-running American animated program, and in</desc>

Hollyoaks is a long-running British television soap opera, first broadcast on Channel 4 on 23 October 1995. It was originally devised by Phil Redmond, who has also devised shows including Brookside and Grange Hill. The programme is set in a fictional suburb of Chester called Hollyoaks and is centred around a local further education college called Hollyoaks Community College, with the characters generally being in their late teens or early twenties. Since 1995, the cast has expanded from just seven major characters to approximately 50 cast members. Since the long-serving producer Bryan Kirkwood quit in 2009, the role of series producer has seen several changes. Kirkwood's successor Lucy Allan stepped down from her position in 2010 after just twelve months, and her replacement, former The Bill producer Paul Marquess took control later that year. Like his predecessor, Marquess left the series after a year and Gareth Philips was appointed as series producer. Emma Smithwick later replaced Phillips as a permanent replacement. Smithwick was a series editor of the soap for a while, before taking on the role of producer in Autumn 2011.

The series finished in 1994 but remains popular well over a decade after the last episode was aired. The series was also shown in Gaelic in Scotland, where it was known as Sam Smalaidh. The series has been sold to over 40 countries, from Australia to Norway and is used across the United Kingdom to promote fire safety.

Bananas in Pyjamas is an Australian children's television show that premiered on 20 July 1992 on ABC. It has since become syndicated in many different countries, and dubbed into other languages. In the United States, the "Pyjamas" in the title was modified to reflect the American spelling pajamas. This aired in syndication from 1995 to 1997 as a half-hour series, then became a 15-minute show paired with a short-lived 15-minute series The Crayon Box, under a 30-minute block produced by Sachs Family Entertainment titled Bananas in Pajamas &amp; The Crayon Box. Additionally, the characters and a scene from the show were featured in the Kids for Character sequel titled Kids for Character: Choices Count. The pilot episode was Pink Mug.
The concept was inspired by the success of the song Bananas in Pyjamas, written by Carey Blyton in 1967, on Play School. This song, which had become a regular item on Play School, became the theme of the new series.
The series was revamped in May 2011, now as a CGI series created by Southern Star Entertainment.
The main characters are two humanoid bananas named B1 and B2. Other characters include three teddy bears named Amy, Lulu and Morgan, and Rat in a Hat.</desc>

It is the second-longest-running drama and most popular soap opera on Australian television. It originally screened on Sunday, 17 January as a 93-minute pilot episode, or a television film as it is known, and a day later aired at its usual time of 22 minutes.

Neighbours is an Australian television soap opera. It was first broadcast on the Seven Network on 18 March 1985. It was created by TV executive Reg Watson, who proposed the idea of making a show that focused on realistic stories and portrayed adults and teenagers who talk openly and solve their problems together. Seven decided to commission the show following the success of Watson's Sons and Daughters, which aired on the network. Although successful in Melbourne, Neighbours underperformed in the Sydney market and struggled for months before Seven cancelled it. The show was immediately bought by rival network Ten. After taking over production of the show, the new network had to build replica sets because Seven destroyed the originals to prevent its rival from obtaining them. Ten began screening Neighbours on 20 January 1986, taking off where the previous series left off and commencing with episode 171. Neighbours has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and in 2005, it was inducted collectively into the Logie Hall of Fame. On 11 January 2011, Neighbours moved to Ten's new digital channel, Eleven.

CSI: Miami (Crime Scene Investigation: Miami) is an American police procedural television series which ran from September 23, 2002 to April 8, 2012 on CBS. It is the first spin-off of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.
The pilot episode was first broadcast in United States on May 9, 2002, as an episode of CSI from the second season. The series was produced in partnership with the Canadian media company Alliance Atlantis and CBS Television Studios.
On February 1, 2012, it was announced that the tenth season of CSI: Miami would be trimmed to nineteen episodes to make room for the debut of midseason replacement NYC 22. On May 13, 2012, both series were canceled.
CSI: Miami was filmed primarily in the United States. Indoor scenes were shot at Raleigh Manhattan Studios in Manhattan Beach, California. The majority of all outdoor scenes were filmed in Long Beach, California, as well as portions of Manhattan Beach and Redondo Beach. Beach areas of Downtown Long Beach were often used for other outdoor scenes: Marina Green Park and Rainbow Lagoon Park. The newly constructed high-rise condos there gave the pretense of being in Miami.

Ice Road Truckers (commercially initialized as IRT) is a documentary-style reality television series that premiered on History on June 17, 2007. It features the activities of drivers who operate trucks on seasonal routes crossing frozen lakes and rivers in remote arctic territories in Canada and Alaska, as well as Alaska's improved but still remote Dalton Highway.
In 2000, History aired a 46-minute episode titled "Ice Road Truckers" as part of the Suicide Missions (later Dangerous Missions) series. Based on the book Denison's Ice Road by Edith Iglauer, the episode detailed the treacherous job of driving trucks over frozen lakes, also known as ice roads, in Canada's Northwest Territories. After 2000, reruns of the documentary were aired as an episode of the series Modern Marvels instead. Under this banner, the Ice Road Truckers show garnered very good ratings.
In 2006, The History Channel hired Thom Beers, owner of Original Productions and executive producer of Deadliest Catch, to create a series based on the Ice Road book. Shot in high definition (although the season ended before History HD was launched in the US), the show "charts two months in the lives of six extraordinary men</desc>

Wildlife SOS is a TV show on Animal Planet, based in the UK's Wildlife Aid in Leatherhead, Surrey. The show has been running since 1996 and produced by Simon Cowell's Wild Productions. And can be found on Animal Planet, Channel 5 and DMAX (relative to May 2009). It is run almost completely by volunteers. Whilst Simon (founder of the charity) is often wandering around the British country side, rescuing injured, sick or orphaned wildlife, other volunteers are usually at the hospital treating and raising patients, so they can be ready to be released back into the wild.
In 1996, following a fire that destroyed one third of the hospital complex, Cowell found his organisation reliant on media attention for its continued survival. Cowell was approached by representatives of the newly formed Animal Planet channel to produce a television series chronicling the drama of life in the wildlife rescue facility. The show experienced long-term success; it has been cited as "the longest-running animal rescue TV series" and continues to broadcast on Animal Planet, and various other channels owned by Discovery Communications.

Alan Carr: Chatty Man (also simply known as Chatty Man) is an award-winning British comedy chat show presented by comedian Alan Carr. The show features interviews with celebrity guests, sketches, topical chat and music.
The show was first on as a pilot in late May 2009, the show proved popular with the public and was commissioned for a series. The first episode drew in a total of 2.15 million viewers. To date, the show has rebroadcast 7 series and 55 episodes. Carr has signed a new deal worth £4 million, which will keep the show on air to 2014, spanning another four more series.
A structural difference from other British chat shows is that while the guests for each episode of Chatty Man all tape on the same day, there is no on screen interaction between the guests. A guest will be introduced and be interviewed, and then they are gone when the next guest comes out. An advantage to this taping process is the fact that Carr is able to pretape interviews with certain guests. If a particular guest is unavailable to be interviewed on the chosen week, an interview can be pre-taped and slotted in during the next week's editing.

Homes Under the Hammer is a BBC One morning television series, which has been running since 2003. Its main presenters are Lucy Alexander and Martin Roberts, although in series three Marc Woodward and Jasmine Birtles alternated presenting duties with Alexander and Roberts. The series is the BBC's most successful show that has been shown in the 10.00am slot, regularly attaining a 30% share for new episodes.
Each episode of the show follows three properties (or two for 30-minute shows) which were bought at auction - often ones that require significant refurbishment. A cross-section of properties are featured including terraced, commercial, rural, and vacant land. The programme follows a set formula. One of the presenters will view the property prior to going up for auction giving their opinion on it and its potential problems as well as attractive features. A local estate agent will also be invited to give their opinion on the property. The auction will then be shown and the final sale price revealed.
It is at this point we first meet the new buyer, and Martin or Lucy will interview them and find out their background, why they bought the property, whether they are happy with it given</desc>

Doctors is a British daytime television soap opera, set in the fictional Midland town of Letherbridge, defined as being close to the city of Birmingham, following the staff and their families of a doctor's surgery.
Doctors is produced by BBC Birmingham and is screened on BBC One, with the first episode broadcast on 26 March 2000. It was created by Chris Murray, with Mal Young developing it and Carson Black the original producer. The show has been shown at lunchtime since its inception, originally at 12.30pm as a lead-in to the BBC's One O'Clock News. After it was temporarily moved to allow for extended news coverage of the September 11th 2001 attacks, its regular slot changed to 2:10 pm, following directly after Neighbours, after ratings rose to a 25% audience share. When the BBC lost Neighbours to Channel 5 in January 2008, it moved into the Australian soap's old slot of 1:45pm. For a brief trial period in Summer 2000, selected episodes from the first series were shown on Fridays at 7 pm and from 16 February 2009, the show began transmitting in high definition on BBC HD at 4:00pm the same day.

Perfection is a game show shown on BBC Two, hosted by Nick Knowles. It was first broadcast on 17 January 2011.
Four players, referred to by the host as the "Usual Suspects", compete. One contestant is chosen at random from the four to compete in the main game on stage, while the other three play against the contestant from their soundproof booth. In each of the three initial rounds of the game, the host starts by turning off the booth, so the Usual Suspects can neither hear nor see anything happening on stage. The contestant is then given four true-or-false statements to answer in 45 seconds. Once all four answers have been locked in, the booth is turned back on so the Usual Suspects can see the contestant's answers.
The host then reveals how many answers the contestant got right, but not which specific ones. If all four are correct, the contestant wins the round immediately. If the contestant got less than four correct, the Usual Suspects have the chance to change the contestant's answers, with the knowledge of how many he_she got wrong. Should the Usual Suspects correctly change the contestant's answers, they win the round. If they get one wrong though, neither contestant nor</desc>

Pointless is a quiz show shown on BBC One, hosted by Alexander Armstrong, with Richard Osman as an assistant. It has been broadcast since 24 August 2009.
Similar to Family Fortunes, contestants must give answers to a question which had previously been asked to one hundred members of the public. However, there are important differences:
The object of the game is to score as few points as possible by giving correct answers that the public have or have not given, ultimately scoring lower than other contestants. The contestants particularly try to look for answers that score no points, which are known as "Pointless" answers. Finding a Pointless Answer adds £250 to the jackpot in rounds prior to the Final, and finding a Pointless Answer in the Final wins the game.
At the beginning of the show there are four teams (five in the first series) of two players. Any team which does not reach the final of the show on their first appearance is invited back for a second (and final) appearance on the next show.
The aim of the show is to get as few points as possible, by answering questions with lesser known correct answers.
Prior to the show, 100 people are each given 100 seconds to give as many</desc>

A cross-section of properties are featured including terraced, commercial, rural, and vacant land. The programme follows a set formula. One of the presenters will view the property prior to going up for auction giving their opinion on it and its potential problems as well as attractive features. A local estate agent will also be invited to give their opinion on the property. The auction will then be shown and the final sale price revealed.

Pointless is a quiz show shown on BBC One, hosted by Alexander Armstrong, with Richard Osman as an assistant. It has been broadcast since 24 August 2009.
Similar to Family Fortunes, contestants must give answers to a question which had previously been asked to one hundred members of the public. However, there are important differences:
The object of the game is to score as few points as possible by giving correct answers that the public have or have not given, ultimately scoring lower than other contestants. The contestants particularly try to look for answers that score no points, which are known as "Pointless" answers. Finding a Pointless Answer adds £250 to the jackpot in rounds prior to the Final, and finding a Pointless Answer in the Final wins the game.
At the beginning of the show there are four teams (five in the first series) of two players. Any team which does not reach the final of the show on their first appearance is invited back for a second (and final) appearance on the next show.
The aim of the show is to get as few points as possible, by answering questions with lesser known correct answers.
Prior to the show, 100 people are each given 100 seconds to give as many</desc>

The series is the BBC's most successful show that has been shown in the 10.00am slot, regularly attaining a 30% share for new episodes.
Each episode of the show follows three properties (or two for 30-minute shows) which were bought at auction - often ones that require significant refurbishment. A cross-section of properties are featured including terraced, commercial, rural, and vacant land. The programme follows a set formula. One of the presenters will view the property prior to going up for auction giving their opinion on it and its potential problems as well as attractive features. A local estate agent will also be invited to give their opinion on the property. The auction will then be shown and the final sale price revealed.
It is at this point we first meet the new buyer, and Martin or Lucy will interview them and find out their background, why they bought the property, whether they are happy with it given</desc>

Reporting Scotland is BBC Scotland's national television news programme. The programme first aired on 1 April 1968, with three main presenters - the most famous being Mary Marquis. It is the only Scottish national news programme in the English language on air, with commercial broadcaster STV providing regional news services for the North of Scotland (including an opt-out for Tayside) and the West and East of Central Scotland. ITV Border's news service is shown in southern Scotland and Cumbria.
Although BBC Television had been established in Scotland since February 1952 and had broadcast some opt-out programming, it did not start its Scottish television news service until Friday August 30 1957, initially as a five-minute bulletin at 6.05pm on weekdays. The BBC was keen to launch the Scottish News Summary ahead of its new rival, Scottish Television (STV) - as it turned out, STV began broadcasting the day after the launch of what was the BBC's first regional TV news bulletin.

Doctors is a British daytime television soap opera, set in the fictional Midland town of Letherbridge, defined as being close to the city of Birmingham, following the staff and their families of a doctor's surgery.
Doctors is produced by BBC Birmingham and is screened on BBC One, with the first episode broadcast on 26 March 2000. It was created by Chris Murray, with Mal Young developing it and Carson Black the original producer. The show has been shown at lunchtime since its inception, originally at 12.30pm as a lead-in to the BBC's One O'Clock News. After it was temporarily moved to allow for extended news coverage of the September 11th 2001 attacks, its regular slot changed to 2:10 pm, following directly after Neighbours, after ratings rose to a 25% audience share. When the BBC lost Neighbours to Channel 5 in January 2008, it moved into the Australian soap's old slot of 1:45pm. For a brief trial period in Summer 2000, selected episodes from the first series were shown on Fridays at 7 pm and from 16 February 2009, the show began transmitting in high definition on BBC HD at 4:00pm the same day.

Perfection is a game show shown on BBC Two, hosted by Nick Knowles. It was first broadcast on 17 January 2011.
Four players, referred to by the host as the "Usual Suspects", compete. One contestant is chosen at random from the four to compete in the main game on stage, while the other three play against the contestant from their soundproof booth. In each of the three initial rounds of the game, the host starts by turning off the booth, so the Usual Suspects can neither hear nor see anything happening on stage. The contestant is then given four true-or-false statements to answer in 45 seconds. Once all four answers have been locked in, the booth is turned back on so the Usual Suspects can see the contestant's answers.
The host then reveals how many answers the contestant got right, but not which specific ones. If all four are correct, the contestant wins the round immediately. If the contestant got less than four correct, the Usual Suspects have the chance to change the contestant's answers, with the knowledge of how many he_she got wrong. Should the Usual Suspects correctly change the contestant's answers, they win the round. If they get one wrong though, neither contestant nor</desc>

Pointless is a quiz show shown on BBC One, hosted by Alexander Armstrong, with Richard Osman as an assistant. It has been broadcast since 24 August 2009.
Similar to Family Fortunes, contestants must give answers to a question which had previously been asked to one hundred members of the public. However, there are important differences:
The object of the game is to score as few points as possible by giving correct answers that the public have or have not given, ultimately scoring lower than other contestants. The contestants particularly try to look for answers that score no points, which are known as "Pointless" answers. Finding a Pointless Answer adds £250 to the jackpot in rounds prior to the Final, and finding a Pointless Answer in the Final wins the game.
At the beginning of the show there are four teams (five in the first series) of two players. Any team which does not reach the final of the show on their first appearance is invited back for a second (and final) appearance on the next show.
The aim of the show is to get as few points as possible, by answering questions with lesser known correct answers.

The series is the BBC's most successful show that has been shown in the 10.00am slot, regularly attaining a 30% share for new episodes.
Each episode of the show follows three properties (or two for 30-minute shows) which were bought at auction - often ones that require significant refurbishment. A cross-section of properties are featured including terraced, commercial, rural, and vacant land. The programme follows a set formula. One of the presenters will view the property prior to going up for auction giving their opinion on it and its potential problems as well as attractive features. A local estate agent will also be invited to give their opinion on the property. The auction will then be shown and the final sale price revealed.

The programme can be watched in any part of the UK (and Europe) on digital satellite channel 972 on the BBC UK regional TV on satellite service. Selected video packages from the programme are available on the BBC news website.
The programme began at 6:10pm on Monday 17 September 1962. Its predecessor, a short News from Wales bulletin, started in 1957 and was originally presented by Michael Aspel. The new programme, originally presented by Brian Hoey, shared a 25-minute timeslot for regional news with Points West from Bristol - at the time, both programmes were broadcast to Wales and the West of England from the Wenvoe transmitter near Cardiff.
By February 1964, two new television regions, BBC Wales and BBC West, had been created with the addition of a new channel (13) for Wales on Wenvoe. Wales Today thus became a 25-minute programme broadcast only to Wales while Points West was only broadcast to the West of England.

Doctors is a British daytime television soap opera, set in the fictional Midland town of Letherbridge, defined as being close to the city of Birmingham, following the staff and their families of a doctor's surgery.
Doctors is produced by BBC Birmingham and is screened on BBC One, with the first episode broadcast on 26 March 2000. It was created by Chris Murray, with Mal Young developing it and Carson Black the original producer. The show has been shown at lunchtime since its inception, originally at 12.30pm as a lead-in to the BBC's One O'Clock News. After it was temporarily moved to allow for extended news coverage of the September 11th 2001 attacks, its regular slot changed to 2:10 pm, following directly after Neighbours, after ratings rose to a 25% audience share. When the BBC lost Neighbours to Channel 5 in January 2008, it moved into the Australian soap's old slot of 1:45pm. For a brief trial period in Summer 2000, selected episodes from the first series were shown on Fridays at 7 pm and from 16 February 2009, the show began transmitting in high definition on BBC HD at 4:00pm the same day.

Perfection is a game show shown on BBC Two, hosted by Nick Knowles. It was first broadcast on 17 January 2011.
Four players, referred to by the host as the "Usual Suspects", compete. One contestant is chosen at random from the four to compete in the main game on stage, while the other three play against the contestant from their soundproof booth. In each of the three initial rounds of the game, the host starts by turning off the booth, so the Usual Suspects can neither hear nor see anything happening on stage. The contestant is then given four true-or-false statements to answer in 45 seconds. Once all four answers have been locked in, the booth is turned back on so the Usual Suspects can see the contestant's answers.
The host then reveals how many answers the contestant got right, but not which specific ones. If all four are correct, the contestant wins the round immediately. If the contestant got less than four correct, the Usual Suspects have the chance to change the contestant's answers, with the knowledge of how many he_she got wrong. Should the Usual Suspects correctly change the contestant's answers, they win the round. If they get one wrong though, neither contestant nor</desc>

Wales Today is the BBC's national news programme for Wales, broadcast on BBC One Wales from the headquarters of BBC Wales in Llandaff, Cardiff.
The programme can be watched in any part of the UK (and Europe) on digital satellite channel 972 on the BBC UK regional TV on satellite service. Selected video packages from the programme are available on the BBC news website.
The programme began at 6:10pm on Monday 17 September 1962. Its predecessor, a short News from Wales bulletin, started in 1957 and was originally presented by Michael Aspel. The new programme, originally presented by Brian Hoey, shared a 25-minute timeslot for regional news with Points West from Bristol - at the time, both programmes were broadcast to Wales and the West of England from the Wenvoe transmitter near Cardiff.
By February 1964, two new television regions, BBC Wales and BBC West, had been created with the addition of a new channel (13) for Wales on Wenvoe. Wales Today thus became a 25-minute programme broadcast only to Wales while Points West was only broadcast to the West of England.

Homes Under the Hammer is a BBC One morning television series, which has been running since 2003. Its main presenters are Lucy Alexander and Martin Roberts, although in series three Marc Woodward and Jasmine Birtles alternated presenting duties with Alexander and Roberts. The series is the BBC's most successful show that has been shown in the 10.00am slot, regularly attaining a 30% share for new episodes.
Each episode of the show follows three properties (or two for 30-minute shows) which were bought at auction - often ones that require significant refurbishment. A cross-section of properties are featured including terraced, commercial, rural, and vacant land. The programme follows a set formula. One of the presenters will view the property prior to going up for auction giving their opinion on it and its potential problems as well as attractive features. A local estate agent will also be invited to give their opinion on the property. The auction will then be shown and the final sale price revealed.
It is at this point we first meet the new buyer, and Martin or Lucy will interview them and find out their background, why they bought the property, whether they are happy with it given</desc>

Don't Get Done, Get Dom is a British reality television series which helps consumers get good deals when purchasing goods. The show lends its name from its presenter Dominic Littlewood. It is aired on BBC One and repeated on BBC Two in the UK.
Series one was first aired in June 2006 and a second series was later commissioned and began to air in June 2007. Series three began in June 2008. Series four aired for two weeks on BBC in late May to early June 2010. Series five began on 25 April 2011. Series six was shown from 9–27 April 2012.
During the show, a member of the public is "tutored" into getting a better deal on a product which they are attempting to buy; typically giving them more confidence in talking to and making deals with the store assistants and managers. Examples from the series are people purchasing video cameras and sports gear.
This is achieved by Littlewood seeing camera footage of a first attempt, and giving them pointers. After this they try another shop but this time Littlewood can communicate to the member of the public by means of a hidden earpiece.

It is normally shown weekdays every week.

Great British Railway Journeys is a BBC travel documentary television series presented by Michael Portillo. The first series premiered on 4 January 2010 on BBC Two, running for 20 half-hour episodes; two further seasons followed in 2011 and in 2012, but with each season extended from 20 to 25 episodes; a fourth season is being filmed for release in early 2013. In the series, Portillo travels around the British railway network, guided by a Victorian guidebook written by George Bradshaw, and compares how the destinations have changed in Victorian and modern times.
Travelling around Great Britain by train, Portillo uses a copy of Victorian cartographer George Bradshaw's Railway Companion to compare and contrast modern Britain with that documented by Bradshaw in the 1840s, visiting recommended points of interest which would have been of interest to the Victorians. George Bradshaw was a cartographer who in 1840 became the first person to produce a comprehensive timetable and travel guide of the railway system in Great Britain, which at the time although extensive, still comprised a series of fragmented and competing railway companies and lines each publishing their own literature.

Funny Business is a documentary style television series about the craft of comedy consisting of six 50-minute episodes. The first episode aired in the UK 22 November 1992. The show was also shown in Germany and released on video. It was directed by David Hinton. The writers were Rowan Atkinson, Robin Driscoll, and David Hinton. It was produced by Tiger Television Productions.
The show featured appearances by many comedians, including Rowan Atkinson who made an appearance both as the presenter_narrator, and as an aspiring comedy actor named Kevin. Atkinson demonstrated many of the principles of comedy (slapstick, mime, etc.) in a manner which was instantly identifiable to anyone familiar with his Mr. Bean character.

The Culture Show is a weekly BBC Two Arts magazine programme. It is broadcast in the UK on Thursday nights at 7pm, focusing on the best of the week's arts and culture news, covering books, art, film, architecture, music, visual fashion and the performing arts. The show is now in its eighth year, having weathered early criticism to establish itself as one of the longest-running Arts magazine shows in the history of BBC television.
Launched in November 2004, the show initially transmitted on Thursday nights in a 7pm slot, lasting 60 minutes. The first main presenter was Verity Sharp, though she shared presenting duties in the show's first run with Kwame Kwei-Armah and Andrew Graham-Dixon. The first series included strong articles on film director Martin Scorsese, the conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim, the then little-known indie rock group Kaiser Chiefs and the contemporary visual artist Anselm Kiefer, among others. The launch editor, George Entwistle, was previously editor of BBC Two's flagship current affairs programme Newsnight.
Entwistle was succeeded as editor by Edward Morgan in summer 2005. In May 2006, the show was moved to Saturday nights, shortened to 50 minutes, and</desc>

Newsnight is a BBC Television current affairs programme noted for its in-depth analysis and often robust cross-examination of senior politicians. Jeremy Paxman has been its main presenter for over two decades.
Several of the programme's editors over the years have gone on to senior positions within the BBC and elsewhere. Paxman's fellow presenters are Gavin Esler, Kirsty Wark and Emily Maitlis. Newsnight has been broadcast on BBC Two since 1980. It goes out on weekday evenings between 10:30pm and 11:20pm. Occasionally it may have an extended edition if there is an especially eventful event in the news - as happened on July 7 2011, when closure of the News of the World led to an extended version which went on until 11:35 pm. Recordings are available within the UK via the BBC website. A weekly 26-minute digest edition of Newsnight is screened on the corporation's international channel, BBC World News.
Newsnight in its current format began on 30 January 1980, although a shorter news bulletin of the same name had run in its late-night BBC2 slot during the 1970s. Its launch was delayed for four months by the Association of Broadcasting Staff, at the time the main BBC trade union.</desc>

See Hear is a weekly magazine programme for deaf and hard of hearing people in the UK, broadcast on Wednesday afternoons at 1pm. The programme focuses on the British and the worldwide deaf community and covers a broad range of topics from areas such as education, deaf people's rights, technology and language. A regular segment is given over to Deaf News, which is presented by Tessa Padden.

Homes Under the Hammer is a BBC One morning television series, which has been running since 2003. Its main presenters are Lucy Alexander and Martin Roberts, although in series three Marc Woodward and Jasmine Birtles alternated presenting duties with Alexander and Roberts. The series is the BBC's most successful show that has been shown in the 10.00am slot, regularly attaining a 30% share for new episodes.
Each episode of the show follows three properties (or two for 30-minute shows) which were bought at auction - often ones that require significant refurbishment. A cross-section of properties are featured including terraced, commercial, rural, and vacant land. The programme follows a set formula. One of the presenters will view the property prior to going up for auction giving their opinion on it and its potential problems as well as attractive features. A local estate agent will also be invited to give their opinion on the property. The auction will then be shown and the final sale price revealed.
It is at this point we first meet the new buyer, and Martin or Lucy will interview them and find out their background, why they bought the property, whether they are happy with it given</desc>

Don't Get Done, Get Dom is a British reality television series which helps consumers get good deals when purchasing goods. The show lends its name from its presenter Dominic Littlewood. It is aired on BBC One and repeated on BBC Two in the UK.
Series one was first aired in June 2006 and a second series was later commissioned and began to air in June 2007. Series three began in June 2008. Series four aired for two weeks on BBC in late May to early June 2010. Series five began on 25 April 2011. Series six was shown from 9–27 April 2012.
During the show, a member of the public is "tutored" into getting a better deal on a product which they are attempting to buy; typically giving them more confidence in talking to and making deals with the store assistants and managers. Examples from the series are people purchasing video cameras and sports gear.
This is achieved by Littlewood seeing camera footage of a first attempt, and giving them pointers. After this they try another shop but this time Littlewood can communicate to the member of the public by means of a hidden earpiece.

Since the spin-off show finished, Jeremy Vine has continued to host the second half of each series, which broadcasts 52 weeks a year.

It is normally shown weekdays every week.

Great British Railway Journeys is a BBC travel documentary television series presented by Michael Portillo. The first series premiered on 4 January 2010 on BBC Two, running for 20 half-hour episodes; two further seasons followed in 2011 and in 2012, but with each season extended from 20 to 25 episodes; a fourth season is being filmed for release in early 2013. In the series, Portillo travels around the British railway network, guided by a Victorian guidebook written by George Bradshaw, and compares how the destinations have changed in Victorian and modern times.
Travelling around Great Britain by train, Portillo uses a copy of Victorian cartographer George Bradshaw's Railway Companion to compare and contrast modern Britain with that documented by Bradshaw in the 1840s, visiting recommended points of interest which would have been of interest to the Victorians. George Bradshaw was a cartographer who in 1840 became the first person to produce a comprehensive timetable and travel guide of the railway system in Great Britain, which at the time although extensive, still comprised a series of fragmented and competing railway companies and lines each publishing their own literature.

The show featured appearances by many comedians, including Rowan Atkinson who made an appearance both as the presenter_narrator, and as an aspiring comedy actor named Kevin. Atkinson demonstrated many of the principles of comedy (slapstick, mime, etc.) in a manner which was instantly identifiable to anyone familiar with his Mr. Bean character.

Newsnight Scotland is a BBC Scotland television news programme which started on Monday 4 October 1999. The programme is aired from BBC Pacific Quay in Glasgow, and is an opt out of the main London-based Newsnight programme. It is on at 11pm from Mondays to Thursdays, replacing the last twenty minutes of Newsnight on BBC Two Scotland (available from the Astra 2D satellite outside Scotland).
Newsnight Scotland covers all topical and political issues that affect Scotland. Often the issues derive from the goings-on at the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood. The programme has investigated many topics, including the costs of the construction of the Holyrood site. It reported in great detail about the decisions leading to this, including the competition for Scotland's new parliament. The biggest story covered so far was the parliament itself; with extensive coverage of the Fraser Inquiry.
Newsnight Scotland came about as a result of calls for a Scottish-based version of the BBC News at Six (the so-called "Scottish Six") following the vote in favour of Scottish devolution. As this did not come about a 'compromise' was then reached in 1999, when Newsnight Scotland was devised.

Homes Under the Hammer is a BBC One morning television series, which has been running since 2003. Its main presenters are Lucy Alexander and Martin Roberts, although in series three Marc Woodward and Jasmine Birtles alternated presenting duties with Alexander and Roberts. The series is the BBC's most successful show that has been shown in the 10.00am slot, regularly attaining a 30% share for new episodes.
Each episode of the show follows three properties (or two for 30-minute shows) which were bought at auction - often ones that require significant refurbishment. A cross-section of properties are featured including terraced, commercial, rural, and vacant land. The programme follows a set formula. One of the presenters will view the property prior to going up for auction giving their opinion on it and its potential problems as well as attractive features. A local estate agent will also be invited to give their opinion on the property. The auction will then be shown and the final sale price revealed.
It is at this point we first meet the new buyer, and Martin or Lucy will interview them and find out their background, why they bought the property, whether they are happy with it given</desc>

Don't Get Done, Get Dom is a British reality television series which helps consumers get good deals when purchasing goods. The show lends its name from its presenter Dominic Littlewood. It is aired on BBC One and repeated on BBC Two in the UK.
Series one was first aired in June 2006 and a second series was later commissioned and began to air in June 2007. Series three began in June 2008. Series four aired for two weeks on BBC in late May to early June 2010. Series five began on 25 April 2011. Series six was shown from 9–27 April 2012.
During the show, a member of the public is "tutored" into getting a better deal on a product which they are attempting to buy; typically giving them more confidence in talking to and making deals with the store assistants and managers. Examples from the series are people purchasing video cameras and sports gear.
This is achieved by Littlewood seeing camera footage of a first attempt, and giving them pointers. After this they try another shop but this time Littlewood can communicate to the member of the public by means of a hidden earpiece.
The show also helps out people in need, who have been treated unfairly, to get deals or refunds on products or</desc>

Eggheads is a BBC quiz show created by 12 Yard Productions, first broadcast in 2003, and co-presented by Dermot Murnaghan and Jeremy Vine. For the 2008 series, Jeremy Vine was brought in to present on nights when Murnaghan was hosting the spinoff series Are You an Egghead? This happened again from October 2009 while Murnaghan presented the second series of the spinoff show. Since the spin-off show finished, Jeremy Vine has continued to host the second half of each series, which broadcasts 52 weeks a year. The show pits a team of five 'Eggheads' (made up from seven highly regarded quiz and game show champions, rotating each episode) against a series of teams of five 'challengers' who in each episode attempt to beat the Eggheads through a series of rounds. It is normally shown weekdays every week.
The title sequence consists of a voiceover by the host stating 'These people are amongst the greatest quiz players in Britain. Together they make up the Eggheads, arguably the most formidable quiz team in the country. The question is: can they be beaten?'

Great British Railway Journeys is a BBC travel documentary television series presented by Michael Portillo. The first series premiered on 4 January 2010 on BBC Two, running for 20 half-hour episodes; two further seasons followed in 2011 and in 2012, but with each season extended from 20 to 25 episodes; a fourth season is being filmed for release in early 2013. In the series, Portillo travels around the British railway network, guided by a Victorian guidebook written by George Bradshaw, and compares how the destinations have changed in Victorian and modern times.
Travelling around Great Britain by train, Portillo uses a copy of Victorian cartographer George Bradshaw's Railway Companion to compare and contrast modern Britain with that documented by Bradshaw in the 1840s, visiting recommended points of interest which would have been of interest to the Victorians. George Bradshaw was a cartographer who in 1840 became the first person to produce a comprehensive timetable and travel guide of the railway system in Great Britain, which at the time although extensive, still comprised a series of fragmented and competing railway companies and lines each publishing their own literature.

Funny Business is a documentary style television series about the craft of comedy consisting of six 50-minute episodes. The first episode aired in the UK 22 November 1992. The show was also shown in Germany and released on video. It was directed by David Hinton. The writers were Rowan Atkinson, Robin Driscoll, and David Hinton. It was produced by Tiger Television Productions.
The show featured appearances by many comedians, including Rowan Atkinson who made an appearance both as the presenter_narrator, and as an aspiring comedy actor named Kevin. Atkinson demonstrated many of the principles of comedy (slapstick, mime, etc.) in a manner which was instantly identifiable to anyone familiar with his Mr. Bean character.
In this episode, it is claimed that the three principal mechanics behind (visual) comedy are for an object or person to
The documentary then goes on to show these mechanics at work in different embodiments, each time illustrated with examples of mostly early visual comedy.

It is broadcast in the UK on Thursday nights at 7pm, focusing on the best of the week's arts and culture news, covering books, art, film, architecture, music, visual fashion and the performing arts. The show is now in its eighth year, having weathered early criticism to establish itself as one of the longest-running Arts magazine shows in the history of BBC television.
Launched in November 2004, the show initially transmitted on Thursday nights in a 7pm slot, lasting 60 minutes. The first main presenter was Verity Sharp, though she shared presenting duties in the show's first run with Kwame Kwei-Armah and Andrew Graham-Dixon. The first series included strong articles on film director Martin Scorsese, the conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim, the then little-known indie rock group Kaiser Chiefs and the contemporary visual artist Anselm Kiefer, among others. The launch editor, George Entwistle, was previously editor of BBC Two's flagship current affairs programme Newsnight.

Newsnight is a BBC Television current affairs programme noted for its in-depth analysis and often robust cross-examination of senior politicians. Jeremy Paxman has been its main presenter for over two decades.
Several of the programme's editors over the years have gone on to senior positions within the BBC and elsewhere. Paxman's fellow presenters are Gavin Esler, Kirsty Wark and Emily Maitlis. Newsnight has been broadcast on BBC Two since 1980. It goes out on weekday evenings between 10:30pm and 11:20pm. Occasionally it may have an extended edition if there is an especially eventful event in the news - as happened on July 7 2011, when closure of the News of the World led to an extended version which went on until 11:35 pm. Recordings are available within the UK via the BBC website. A weekly 26-minute digest edition of Newsnight is screened on the corporation's international channel, BBC World News.
Newsnight in its current format began on 30 January 1980, although a shorter news bulletin of the same name had run in its late-night BBC2 slot during the 1970s. Its launch was delayed for four months by the Association of Broadcasting Staff, at the time the main BBC trade union.</desc>

Freebase:
The World's Strictest Parents (or World's Strictest Parents) is a television series developed by TwentyTwenty Television, originally broadcast in Britain by the BBC. America's CMT (part of MTV Networks) and Australia's Channel Seven have both created localised versions of the programme, with the CMT episodes frequently rebroadcasting on MTV. There is also a German version called "Die strengsten Eltern der Welt" (The strictest Parents of the World).
The concept is that two so-called "unruly" teenagers are sent to live abroad with a strict host family for a week in an attempt to change their behaviour. During the week they receive an impact letter from their real parents with a list of issues they should try to fix.
Unruly British teenagers are sent abroad to live with strict families in an experiment to find out the right way to bring up a child. Generally they spend 10 days with their adopted parents trying to live within their rules.
Series two premiered on BBC Three on the 15th October 2009
Series three premiered on BBC Three on the 11th October 2010, the show returned for a 11 episode run. Whilst not formally announced, it appears the teens now spend a week with their adopted</desc>

Sections include:
Most of these sections are used on every single episode of the show. The others are interchanged depending on the news of the week. The "Mystery Guest" section is a part of the show where a guest is brought in and Russell has to guess why they had been in the news that week.

Family Guy is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the Griffins, a dysfunctional family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.
The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox on May 15, 1998. The show was given the green light and started production. Shortly after the third season of Family Guy aired in 2001, Fox canceled the series. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004.
Family Guy has been nominated for 12 Primetime Emmy Awards and 11 Annie Awards, and has won three of each. In 2009, it was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, the first</desc>

World News Today is a current affairs news programme produced by BBC News and presented by Zeinab Badawi. It was originally conceived as a morning television show aimed at American audiences, hosted by George Alagiah, but later expanded to six editions a day aimed at different markets. There is now one weekday edition only, part-simulcast on BBC Four and BBC World News.
The programme originally used the same graphics and music as BBC World, though when The World on BBC Four was renamed World News Today, all editions were given a separate set of graphics and music. Since April 2008 the standard title sequence used by the BBC's English Regions has been used, with some graphical alterations and with international images included. The first 30 mins of each broadcast is still simulcast on BBC Four.
As part of a channel refresh on BBC World News, five editions of World News Today were replaced on 1 February 2010 with GMT, Impact Asia, The Hub, Business Edition and a standard edition of BBC World News. On Fridays, the programme runs for 30 mins only, which means that BBC World News receive 2 bulletins of BBC World News instead. These air from 1930 to 1940UKT and 2000 to 2030UKT.

Great British Railway Journeys is a BBC travel documentary television series presented by Michael Portillo. The first series premiered on 4 January 2010 on BBC Two, running for 20 half-hour episodes; two further seasons followed in 2011 and in 2012, but with each season extended from 20 to 25 episodes; a fourth season is being filmed for release in early 2013. In the series, Portillo travels around the British railway network, guided by a Victorian guidebook written by George Bradshaw, and compares how the destinations have changed in Victorian and modern times.
Travelling around Great Britain by train, Portillo uses a copy of Victorian cartographer George Bradshaw's Railway Companion to compare and contrast modern Britain with that documented by Bradshaw in the 1840s, visiting recommended points of interest which would have been of interest to the Victorians. George Bradshaw was a cartographer who in 1840 became the first person to produce a comprehensive timetable and travel guide of the railway system in Great Britain, which at the time although extensive, still comprised a series of fragmented and competing railway companies and lines each publishing their own literature.

Hancock's Half Hour is a BBC radio comedy, and later television comedy, series of the 1950s and 60s written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson. The series starred Tony Hancock, with Sid James; the radio version also co-starred, at various times, Moira Lister, Andrée Melly, Hattie Jacques, Bill Kerr and Kenneth Williams. The final television series, renamed simply Hancock, starred Hancock alone.
Comedian Tony Hancock starred in the show, playing an exaggerated and much poorer version of his own character and lifestyle, Anthony Aloysius St John Hancock, a down-at-heel comedian living at the dilapidated 23 Railway Cuttings in East Cheam.
The series was influential in the development of the situation comedy, with its move away from radio variety towards a focus on character development.
The radio version was produced by Dennis Main Wilson for most of its run. After Main Wilson departed for his television career, his role was taken by Tom Ronald. The television series was produced by Duncan Wood. The distinctive tuba-based theme tune was composed by Wally Stott.

Doctors is a British daytime television soap opera, set in the fictional Midland town of Letherbridge, defined as being close to the city of Birmingham, following the staff and their families of a doctor's surgery.
Doctors is produced by BBC Birmingham and is screened on BBC One, with the first episode broadcast on 26 March 2000. It was created by Chris Murray, with Mal Young developing it and Carson Black the original producer. The show has been shown at lunchtime since its inception, originally at 12.30pm as a lead-in to the BBC's One O'Clock News. After it was temporarily moved to allow for extended news coverage of the September 11th 2001 attacks, its regular slot changed to 2:10 pm, following directly after Neighbours, after ratings rose to a 25% audience share. When the BBC lost Neighbours to Channel 5 in January 2008, it moved into the Australian soap's old slot of 1:45pm. For a brief trial period in Summer 2000, selected episodes from the first series were shown on Fridays at 7 pm and from 16 February 2009, the show began transmitting in high definition on BBC HD at 4:00pm the same day.

Bargain Hunt is a British television programme in which two pairs of contestants are challenged to buy antiques at a fair and then sell them in an auction for a profit. It has aired on BBC One since 13 March 2000 in a daytime version and from 22 August 2002 to 13 November 2004 in a primetime version. David Dickinson began as host of the daytime version and went on to also present the primetime version. Tim Wonnacott has presented the daytime version since 2003.
Bargain Hunt has undergone various format and rule changes since it premiered in 2000. Most episodes are 45 minutes in length, though 30-minute versions and one-hour "live" editions have also been produced.
Two teams – designated the "Reds" and the "Blues" – compete. Each team has two members, who wear matching T-shirts or fleeces that correspond to their team's colour. The contestants in most episodes are members of the public, though some shows feature teams of celebrity players instead. At the beginning of the show, each team is given a set amount of money with which to purchase antiques. The objective is to find items that will earn the team a profit when later sold at auction. Each team is accompanied by an antiques</desc>

Helicopter Heroes is a British daytime television series, following the lifesaving work of the Yorkshire Air Ambulance. First screened on BBC One in 2007, its first presenter was Top Gear's Richard Hammond. He agreed to front the show to thank the Yorkshire Air Ambulance crew which flew him to hospital in their helicopter after his near-fatal jet engine powered car crash at Elvington Airfield near York.
Very high audience appreciation ratings (AIs) led the BBC to re-commission the show and it has been in production ever since. Several series have been repeated in a primetime slot in slightly shortened form. Since Series 2 it has been fronted by ex-cop and Crimewatch presenter Rav Wilding.
Helicopter Heroes is now on air in Australia, New Zealand and Scandinavia.
Unusually, it is entirely edited in a hangar at Leeds Bradford Airport and shot by a small team from BBC English regions using Sony EX3 HD cameras. Helicopter Heroes was among the first producer-shot observational documentary commissioned by the BBC HD Channel. They have flown more than 1,000 missions in the Yorkshire Air Ambulance's two MD900 Explorer helicopters.

Eggheads is a BBC quiz show created by 12 Yard Productions, first broadcast in 2003, and co-presented by Dermot Murnaghan and Jeremy Vine. For the 2008 series, Jeremy Vine was brought in to present on nights when Murnaghan was hosting the spinoff series Are You an Egghead? This happened again from October 2009 while Murnaghan presented the second series of the spinoff show. Since the spin-off show finished, Jeremy Vine has continued to host the second half of each series, which broadcasts 52 weeks a year. The show pits a team of five 'Eggheads' (made up from seven highly regarded quiz and game show champions, rotating each episode) against a series of teams of five 'challengers' who in each episode attempt to beat the Eggheads through a series of rounds. It is normally shown weekdays every week.
The title sequence consists of a voiceover by the host stating 'These people are amongst the greatest quiz players in Britain. Together they make up the Eggheads, arguably the most formidable quiz team in the country. The question is: can they be beaten?'

Great British Railway Journeys is a BBC travel documentary television series presented by Michael Portillo. The first series premiered on 4 January 2010 on BBC Two, running for 20 half-hour episodes; two further seasons followed in 2011 and in 2012, but with each season extended from 20 to 25 episodes; a fourth season is being filmed for release in early 2013. In the series, Portillo travels around the British railway network, guided by a Victorian guidebook written by George Bradshaw, and compares how the destinations have changed in Victorian and modern times.
Travelling around Great Britain by train, Portillo uses a copy of Victorian cartographer George Bradshaw's Railway Companion to compare and contrast modern Britain with that documented by Bradshaw in the 1840s, visiting recommended points of interest which would have been of interest to the Victorians. George Bradshaw was a cartographer who in 1840 became the first person to produce a comprehensive timetable and travel guide of the railway system in Great Britain, which at the time although extensive, still comprised a series of fragmented and competing railway companies and lines each publishing their own literature.

Funny Business is a documentary style television series about the craft of comedy consisting of six 50-minute episodes. The first episode aired in the UK 22 November 1992. The show was also shown in Germany and released on video. It was directed by David Hinton. The writers were Rowan Atkinson, Robin Driscoll, and David Hinton. It was produced by Tiger Television Productions.
The show featured appearances by many comedians, including Rowan Atkinson who made an appearance both as the presenter_narrator, and as an aspiring comedy actor named Kevin. Atkinson demonstrated many of the principles of comedy (slapstick, mime, etc.) in a manner which was instantly identifiable to anyone familiar with his Mr. Bean character.
In this episode, it is claimed that the three principal mechanics behind (visual) comedy are for an object or person to
The documentary then goes on to show these mechanics at work in different embodiments, each time illustrated with examples of mostly early visual comedy.
In a central part of the documentary, Atkinson emphasizes the need to deliver the comedy with a carefully crafted attitude. The character behind the comedy is at least as important as the techniques</desc>

Newsnight is a BBC Television current affairs programme noted for its in-depth analysis and often robust cross-examination of senior politicians. Jeremy Paxman has been its main presenter for over two decades.
Several of the programme's editors over the years have gone on to senior positions within the BBC and elsewhere. Paxman's fellow presenters are Gavin Esler, Kirsty Wark and Emily Maitlis. Newsnight has been broadcast on BBC Two since 1980. It goes out on weekday evenings between 10:30pm and 11:20pm. Occasionally it may have an extended edition if there is an especially eventful event in the news - as happened on July 7 2011, when closure of the News of the World led to an extended version which went on until 11:35 pm. Recordings are available within the UK via the BBC website. A weekly 26-minute digest edition of Newsnight is screened on the corporation's international channel, BBC World News.
Newsnight in its current format began on 30 January 1980, although a shorter news bulletin of the same name had run in its late-night BBC2 slot during the 1970s. Its launch was delayed for four months by the Association of Broadcasting Staff, at the time the main BBC trade union.</desc>

Hardtalk (styled as HARDtalk) is a flagship BBC television programme, consisting of in-depth half-hour one-on-one interviews.
It is broadcast four days a week (Monday to Thursday) on BBC World News and the BBC News channel. Launched in 1997, much of its worldwide fame is due to its global reach via BBC World. Until early 2005, the host was Tim Sebastian, whose famous, and sometimes controversial, style of tough questioning brought a huge world audience to the show. It is normally broadcast late at night on the BBC News Channel. Until the mid-zeros, it was broadcast at around 11: 30 p.m., but in more recent times, it has been broaadcast later, at around half past twelve in the morning.
Since 2006, the show has been presented by Stephen Sackur, who was previously the BBC's correspondent in Washington and Brussels and who is an experienced interviewer who has grilled U.S. Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. He is occasionally replaced by several other well-known BBC presenters such as Zeinab Badawi, Carrie Gracie and Sarah Montague. Other occasional presenters have included Jon Sopel, David Jessel, Lyse Doucet, Nisha Pillai, Noel Thompson and Katya Adler.

Today is an Australian breakfast television program. It has been broadcast live by the Nine Network since 1982. In 2012, the show celebrates its 30th anniversary.
The program airs after Nine Early Morning News and runs from 5.30am to 9am before Mornings. During the course of the London Olympics, a special edition is scheduled to be presented by Karl Stefanovic and Leila McKinnon from London. In 2012, Today received a new logo, set and graphics to counter any competition from Ten's new Breakfast program.
Officially launched as The National Today Show, Today is Australia's longest running morning breakfast news program. The show premiered on 28 June 1982 and celebrated 25 years of broadcasting in 2007.
The original hosts, Steve Liebmann and Sue Kellaway, spent four years together before Liebmann left to present the evening news for Network Ten in Sydney. Former 60 Minutes reporter George Negus took over the male presenting role. After four years, Liebmann returned to the Nine Network, hosting Today with Liz Hayes and Tracy Grimshaw. However, in December 2004, Liebmann suffered a mild heart attack, prompting him to retire from breakfast television. In 2005, National Nine News reporter</desc>

Freebase:
The World Tonight is an English-language newscast of the ABS-CBN News Channel (ANC) and formerly of ABS-CBN. It is anchored by Tina Monzon-Palma on weekdays, and by Gigi Grande on Saturdays and Ron Cruz on Sundays.
The World Tonight premiered on November 21, 1962 at 8:30pm on CBN's (predecessor of ABS-CBN) DZXL-TV Channel 9 as the network's answer to ABC's The Big News, News at Seven on GMA, and NewsWatch on RPN. Co-anchoring the newscast were Hal Bowie, a veteran announcer from ABS-CBN radio, Eric Eloriaga, and Henry Halasan, a former ABS-CBN Cebu talent who was transferred to the network's main offices in Manila as a sales executive. Bowie, who was in his 70s when the newscast first aired, later bowed out of the newscast due to health reasons and concentrated instead on producing news reports for the network. This left Halasan and Eloriaga as main anchorman of the program.
The program was transferred to sister station ABS Channel 3 on the 10:00pm time slot a year later. This happened when Channel 9 premiered Newsbreak with Bong Lapira, who transferred from rival newscast The Big News on ABC. The newscast continued until ABS-CBN's closure by the Marcos government during the</desc>

Drive is a short-lived American action drama television series created by Tim Minear and Ben Queen, produced by Minear, Queen, and Greg Yaitanes, and starring Nathan Fillion, four episodes of which aired on the Fox network in April 2007. Two unaired episodes were later released directly to digital distribution.
The series is set across the backdrop of an illegal automobile road race with the central focus being on the unwitting competitors and, as the plot develops, the unseen puppet masters who sponsor the race. Minear has described the show's thematic tone by saying "a secret, illegal, underground road race can be anything from Cannonball Run to The Game to North by Northwest to Magnolia-on-wheels. Ours is all those things."
Firefly and Serenity star Nathan Fillion, a longtime friend of series creator Tim Minear, plays the lead role of Alex Tully. Ivan Sergei played Tully in the unaired pilot.
The show premiered on April 13, 2007 on CTV in Canada. It debuted in the United States on April 15, 2007 on Fox, and moved into its regular time slot on Mondays the next day; in that slot it faced stiff competition from NBC's Deal or No Deal and ABC's Dancing with the Stars. On April 25,</desc>

Up All Night is an American television comedy series created by Emily Spivey that premiered on NBC on September 14, 2011, at 10 p.m. (E_P), before assuming its regular time slot on Wednesday, September 21, 2011, at 8 p.m. (E_P). The show stars Christina Applegate, Will Arnett, Jennifer Hall and Maya Rudolph. The series was moved to Thursdays, airing after The Office, on January 12, 2012. On May 11, 2012, the series was renewed for a second season. The second season will feature 13 episodes.
The series follows Reagan (Christina Applegate), a producer on her best friend Ava's (Maya Rudolph) talk show, and Chris (Will Arnett), Reagan's supportive, stay-at-home husband, as they try to adjust to life with their newborn baby Amy.
The series was based on creator Emily Spivey's life when she went back to working on Saturday Night Live after giving birth to a baby boy. Due to the nature of her job, she was required to take care of the baby and work late nights. She decided she wanted to make a show based off those extremes. NBC executives were "supportive and excited" for the new series. On February 1, 2011, Up All Night received a pilot order, written by creator Spivey and directed by</desc>

Hardtalk (styled as HARDtalk) is a flagship BBC television programme, consisting of in-depth half-hour one-on-one interviews.
It is broadcast four days a week (Monday to Thursday) on BBC World News and the BBC News channel. Launched in 1997, much of its worldwide fame is due to its global reach via BBC World. Until early 2005, the host was Tim Sebastian, whose famous, and sometimes controversial, style of tough questioning brought a huge world audience to the show. It is normally broadcast late at night on the BBC News Channel. Until the mid-zeros, it was broadcast at around 11: 30 p.m., but in more recent times, it has been broaadcast later, at around half past twelve in the morning.
Since 2006, the show has been presented by Stephen Sackur, who was previously the BBC's correspondent in Washington and Brussels and who is an experienced interviewer who has grilled U.S. Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. He is occasionally replaced by several other well-known BBC presenters such as Zeinab Badawi, Carrie Gracie and Sarah Montague. Other occasional presenters have included Jon Sopel, David Jessel, Lyse Doucet, Nisha Pillai, Noel Thompson and Katya Adler.

Hardtalk (styled as HARDtalk) is a flagship BBC television programme, consisting of in-depth half-hour one-on-one interviews.
It is broadcast four days a week (Monday to Thursday) on BBC World News and the BBC News channel. Launched in 1997, much of its worldwide fame is due to its global reach via BBC World. Until early 2005, the host was Tim Sebastian, whose famous, and sometimes controversial, style of tough questioning brought a huge world audience to the show. It is normally broadcast late at night on the BBC News Channel. Until the mid-zeros, it was broadcast at around 11: 30 p.m., but in more recent times, it has been broaadcast later, at around half past twelve in the morning.
Since 2006, the show has been presented by Stephen Sackur, who was previously the BBC's correspondent in Washington and Brussels and who is an experienced interviewer who has grilled U.S. Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. He is occasionally replaced by several other well-known BBC presenters such as Zeinab Badawi, Carrie Gracie and Sarah Montague. Other occasional presenters have included Jon Sopel, David Jessel, Lyse Doucet, Nisha Pillai, Noel Thompson and Katya Adler.

Bananas in Pyjamas is an Australian children's television show that premiered on 20 July 1992 on ABC. It has since become syndicated in many different countries, and dubbed into other languages. In the United States, the "Pyjamas" in the title was modified to reflect the American spelling pajamas. This aired in syndication from 1995 to 1997 as a half-hour series, then became a 15-minute show paired with a short-lived 15-minute series The Crayon Box, under a 30-minute block produced by Sachs Family Entertainment titled Bananas in Pajamas &amp; The Crayon Box. Additionally, the characters and a scene from the show were featured in the Kids for Character sequel titled Kids for Character: Choices Count. The pilot episode was Pink Mug.
The concept was inspired by the success of the song Bananas in Pyjamas, written by Carey Blyton in 1967, on Play School. This song, which had become a regular item on Play School, became the theme of the new series.
The series was revamped in May 2011, now as a CGI series created by Southern Star Entertainment.
The main characters are two humanoid bananas named B1 and B2. Other characters include three teddy bears named Amy, Lulu and Morgan, and Rat in a Hat.</desc>

In 2001, Skatoony began as a competition microsite on the Cartoon Network UK website. In 2006, then appeared the first full length Skatoony TV show. However, a few phone-in shows such as Skatoony Quizmas, Ready Steady Skatoony and Skatoony Truckatoony existed before as a sort of continuity during school holidays. These phone-in shows ended in 2005.
On February 9, 2009, Marblemedia announced they would be producing a North American version of the series Skatoony (in French and English) for Teletoon. The Canadian adaptation, titled Skatoony North America to differentiate it from other adaptations follows the same format. The English version of Skatoony is filmed in Toronto, while the French version is filmed in Montreal with a different set of contestants;</desc>

The Flintstones is an animated, prime-time American television sitcom that was broadcast from September 30, 1960 to April 1, 1966, on ABC. The original pilot episode clip however was called the "Flagstones" (which first appeared in 1959 as a 90 second promotion to draw advertisers to the show) and was later reincorporated into the show's 1st episode (3rd episode in original airdate order). The show's name was changed to "The Flintstones" shortly thereafter. The show was produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions, The Flintstones was about a working class Stone Age man's life with his family and his next-door neighbor and best friend.
The show's continuing popularity rested heavily on its juxtaposition of modern everyday concerns in the Stone Age setting.
The show is set in the Stone Age town of Bedrock. (In some of the earlier episodes, it was also referred to as "Rockville".) In this fantasy version of the past, dinosaurs, saber-toothed tigers, woolly mammoths, and other long-extinct animals co-exist with cavemen. Like their mid-20th century peers, these cavemen listen to records, live in split-level homes, and eat out at restaurants, yet their technology is made entirely from</desc>

Wacky Races is an animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera. The series features 11 different cars racing against each other in various road rallies throughout North America, with each driver hoping to win the title of the "World's Wackiest Racer." Wacky Races ran on CBS from September 14, 1968, to January 4, 1969. Seventeen episodes were produced, with each episode featuring two different races.
The cartoon had an unusually large number of regular characters, with twenty-three people and animals spread among the 11 race cars, plus the unseen (and never identified) race announcer. Reruns of the series currently air several times a day on Cartoon Network's classic animation network Boomerang.
One of the unused plans for the series was that the races would be part of a live-action quiz show made by Merrill Heatter and Bob Quigley Productions in which contestants would bet on which Wacky Racer would cross the finish line first. Although the game show concept was eventually scrapped, the series still retained a Hanna-Barbera_Heatter-Quigley dual production credit.

Top Cat is a Hanna-Barbera prime time animated television series which ran from September 27, 1961 to April 18, 1962 for a run of 30 episodes on the ABC network. Reruns are played on Cartoon Network's classic animation network Boomerang.
Originally broadcast on Wednesdays [8:30-9pm Eastern], Top Cat was co-sponsored by Kellogg's and Bristol-Myers (Bufferin). The central character, Top Cat—called T.C. by close friends, "pro-vid-ing it's with dignity" as the lyrics of the theme song say—is the leader of a gang of Manhattan alley cats: Fancy, Spook, Benny the Ball, Brain, and Choo Choo living in Hoagie's Alley.
Top Cat and his gang were inspired by characters from the popular situation comedy You'll Never Get Rich (later called The Phil Silvers Show). Maurice Gosfield, who played Private Duane Doberman on The Phil Silvers Show, also provided the voice for Benny the Ball in Top Cat (Benny's rotund appearance was based on Gosfield too). Even Arnold Stang's voicing of Top Cat strongly resembled Phil Silvers' voice. Another possible source material was Hokey Wolf, a segment on The Huckleberry Hound Show, which also had parallels to The Phil Silvers Show.

Chowder is an American animated television series which ran from November 2, 2007 to August 7, 2010 on Cartoon Network. The series was created by C. H. Greenblatt, a former storyboard artist on SpongeBob SquarePants and The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy.
During his time working on Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants, Greenblatt had been sketching various characters for his own animation series concept. Greenblatt originally based the premise on the idea of the sorcerer's apprentice style of story, such as The Sword in the Stone. The plot devices were modified so that the story revolves around a master chef who teaches his young apprentice how to cook. Chowder himself was developed with no specific species in mind, but rather with the intentions of invoking the image of a child's soft squeeze toy. Some of the inspiration comes from Richard Scarry, with other inspiration from Saturday morning cartoons.
Once Greenblatt pitched the concept to Cartoon Network, it was about two years before the series was approved for production with another year in production before the pilot episode aired. Greenblatt estimates he spent about seven years working on Chowder before the show made it to</desc>

It first aired in the United Kingdom on May 2, 2011 on Cartoon Network as a sneak preview and officially premiered on September 5, 2011.

When Cartoon Network Development Studio Europe was created in 2007, Ben Bocquelet was hired in order to help people pitch their projects to the network. However, when the studio decided to have its employees all pitch their own ideas, he decided to take some of the rejected characters he had created for commercials and put them all in one series, with a school setting. Daniel Lennard, the Vice President of Original Series and Development at Turner Broadcasting UK, liked the idea and the series was ultimately greenlit. There were twenty half-hours worth of episodes written for the first season, but only eighteen were actually created. A second season was announced on March 17, 2011 and it will consist of an</desc>

The Amazing World of Gumball (sometimes referred to simply as Gumball) is a British_American animated television series created by Ben Bocquelet and produced by Cartoon Network Development Studio Europe. It first aired in the United Kingdom on May 2, 2011 on Cartoon Network as a sneak preview and officially premiered on September 5, 2011. In the United States, a sneak peek aired on Cartoon Network on May 3, 2011 and premiered in full on May 9, 2011. The series is rated TV-Y7-FV.
When Cartoon Network Development Studio Europe was created in 2007, Ben Bocquelet was hired in order to help people pitch their projects to the network. However, when the studio decided to have its employees all pitch their own ideas, he decided to take some of the rejected characters he had created for commercials and put them all in one series, with a school setting. Daniel Lennard, the Vice President of Original Series and Development at Turner Broadcasting UK, liked the idea and the series was ultimately greenlit. There were twenty half-hours worth of episodes written for the first season, but only eighteen were actually created. A second season was announced on March 17, 2011 and it will consist of an</desc>

Chowder is an American animated television series which ran from November 2, 2007 to August 7, 2010 on Cartoon Network. The series was created by C. H. Greenblatt, a former storyboard artist on SpongeBob SquarePants and The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy.
During his time working on Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants, Greenblatt had been sketching various characters for his own animation series concept. Greenblatt originally based the premise on the idea of the sorcerer's apprentice style of story, such as The Sword in the Stone. The plot devices were modified so that the story revolves around a master chef who teaches his young apprentice how to cook. Chowder himself was developed with no specific species in mind, but rather with the intentions of invoking the image of a child's soft squeeze toy. Some of the inspiration comes from Richard Scarry, with other inspiration from Saturday morning cartoons.
Once Greenblatt pitched the concept to Cartoon Network, it was about two years before the series was approved for production with another year in production before the pilot episode aired. Greenblatt estimates he spent about seven years working on Chowder before the show made it to</desc>

Johnny Bravo is an American animated television series created by Van Partible for Cartoon Network. The series stars a muscular beefcake young man named Johnny Bravo who dons a pompadour hairstyle and an Elvis Presley-like voice and has a forward, woman-chasing personality. Plots typically revolve around him trying to get a woman that he has targeted throughout the episode to fall in love with him. He is often beaten up or stunned by his target or companions, or is ditched by them in the end.
The series was originally part of a series of shorts on Cartoon Network's animation showcase series World Premiere Toons (also known as the The What a Cartoon! Show.) The popularity of the shorts led to the network commissioning a full series for the show, which premiered on July 14, 1997. The series was renewed for multiple following seasons and finally ended its official run on August 27, 2004.
The series was the second series to be spun from World Premiere Toons, and is the second series under Cartoon Cartoons (a collective name for early Cartoon Network original series). A spin-off of the series, JBVO, was unsuccessful and ran for one season. Many of the writers and directors on the series</desc>

Samurai Jack is an American animated television series created by animator Genndy Tartakovsky that aired on both Cartoon Network and Toonami from 2001 to 2004. It is noted for its highly detailed, outline-free, masking-based animation, as well as for its cinematic style and pacing. It was the first Cartoon Network original series aside from those who comprised the Cartoon Cartoons lineup at the time. It is shown on its sister network Boomerang.
The plots of individual episodes range from dark and epic to light-hearted and comic, but typically follow "Jack", a time-displaced samurai warrior, in his singular quest to find a method of traveling back in time. Many of the battle scenes in the series are reminiscent of samurai films, and since Jack's robotic enemies "bleed" oil or electricity and monsters and aliens bleed slime or goo, the series is able to exhibit the action of these films while avoiding censorship for violence.
Samurai Jack is no longer available to be viewed by American residents via the Toonami Jetstream website. Production on the show was halted in 2004, but it was never officially ended. In return, Tartakovsky has announced plans to direct a theatrical film, but</desc>

Chowder is an American animated television series which ran from November 2, 2007 to August 7, 2010 on Cartoon Network. The series was created by C. H. Greenblatt, a former storyboard artist on SpongeBob SquarePants and The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy.
During his time working on Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants, Greenblatt had been sketching various characters for his own animation series concept. Greenblatt originally based the premise on the idea of the sorcerer's apprentice style of story, such as The Sword in the Stone. The plot devices were modified so that the story revolves around a master chef who teaches his young apprentice how to cook. Chowder himself was developed with no specific species in mind, but rather with the intentions of invoking the image of a child's soft squeeze toy. Some of the inspiration comes from Richard Scarry, with other inspiration from Saturday morning cartoons.
Once Greenblatt pitched the concept to Cartoon Network, it was about two years before the series was approved for production with another year in production before the pilot episode aired. Greenblatt estimates he spent about seven years working on Chowder before the show made it to</desc>

Originally, stand-in presenters came from main BBC News bulletins, including Richard Whitmore. The programme's reporter was Lucy Mathen. By the 1980s, the programme had developed its own presentation team including Roger Finn and Helen Rollason with Craven in the dual role of chief presenter and programme editor.
Shortly before Craven's departure, the show was renamed Newsround, and was now anchored by a rotating team of presenters. Past presenters have included David Bull, Juliet Morris, Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Julie Etchingham, Chris Rogers, Kate Sanderson, Matthew Price, and Becky Jago.

Tikkabilla is a UK children's television programme, shown on BBC1, BBC2 and on the CBeebies channel.
The programme aims to educate pre-school children in an entertaining manner. The title "Tikkabilla" comes from the Punjabi word meaning "Hopscotch", a popular children's game. It was an exceptionally well loved childrens television show.
Each programme is introduced by two adults and a small dragon puppet named Tamba, whom resembles Spyro the Dragon in colouration. Tamba serves as the programme's naive child; the programme's educational content is introduced as the presenters explain things to Tamba. Whilst Tamba appears in every episode, a team of presenters take it in turns to pair-up in each show. These presenters include Justin Fletcher, Sarah-Jane Honeywell, Paul Ewing, Simon Davies, Lorna Laidlaw, Veejay Kaur, Toni Fruitin and Amit Sharma (both series 4 only) and Beverley Hills (series 1-3 only). Tamba is performed by puppeteers Sue Eves (series 1 - 4) who created the voice for Tamba; Alison McGowan (series 2 &amp; 3) and Katherine Smee (series 4). Sue Eves has also written many scripts for the programme.

Chuggington is a British computer-animated television series for children produced by Ludorum plc and on the BBC children's channel CBeebies and other 175 territories throughout the world.
The series is set in the fictional town of Chuggington, and follows the adventures of 6 young novice railway anthropomorphic locomotives, (or "Trainees",) named Wilson, Brewster, Koko, Hoot, Toot and Piper. Throughout each episode the Trainees learn the value of loyal friendship, telling the truth, listening carefully, persisting under adversity, completing tasks, resolving conflict without violence, and many similar important life values. In the show, the locomotives, called "Chuggers", are all intelligent, empathetic, independent and self-directed, with mobile facial features. None of the Chuggers are ever seen to have a crew, although there are several human characters that the Chuggers interact with regularly. This despite the fact that many of the chuggers have crew doors which the chuggers can open and close on their own. Each chugger tends to talk in ways that emphasize their distinct personalities.

Timmy Time is an animated pre-school children's comedy series created by WGBH-TV and Aardman Animations. It started broadcasting in the UK on CBeebies on 6 April 2009. The show is a spin off from the Shaun the Sheep animation which itself is a spin off from the Aardman series Wallace &amp; Gromit, which introduced the character of Shaun. The first two series ran for 26 episodes. In the UK the show's most recent run began in September 2011 on CBeebies.
In this series, Timmy and his friends have to learn to share, make friends and accept their mistakes. They are supervised by two teachers, Harriet the Heron and Osbourne the Owl. The show is aimed at pre-school aged children which the company described as "a natural step for Aardman". It premiered on Playhouse Disney in the US on September 13, 2010 and continues to air as part of the rebranded Disney Junior block.
The show is made up of ten minute episodes, which do not feature any dialogue, much like Shaun the Sheep.</desc>

Tweenies was a television programme aimed at young children, broadcast on the BBC's Cbeebies channel.
The idea for the programme came from Iain Lauchlan and Will Brenton, a pair with a track record of being involved in BBC children's programming. Together with Karl Woolley and Helen Cadwallader they set up Tell-Tale Productions at Elstree Film Studios in Hertfordshire. Iain Lauchlan was a presenter on Play School, Fingermouse and Playdays, meeting Brenton, a director, writer and also a presenter, during the latter. Together they started producing two of the Playdays strands before forming their own production companies Tell-Tale Productions and, more recently, Wish Films. They also created The Fun Song Factory, Boo!, BB3B!, Jim Jam and Sunny, Basil Hair The Squirrel and Entertainment Right's The Magical Lives of Toys.
Tweenies was a production of Tell-Tale Productions in association with the BBC. Animation for the show was produced by A Productions, an animation studio based in Bristol, England, with Ealing Animation providing some animation in a few early episodes.

Big Barn Farm is a live-action television series commissioned by Michael Carrington at the BBC, narrated by Ben Fairman in series 1 and Dave Lamb in series 2. The programmes are about four young animals, the Farmyard Bunch - Petal the piglet, Gobo the ‘kid’ goat, Dash the young donkey and Digger the puppy - and their view of life on Big Barn Farm. Their adventures on the farm revolve around their emotions and the situations they find themselves in. As the Farmyard Bunch explore the day to day routine of life on a farm, so they play, discover and have fun.
As the storylines are from the young animals’ point of view there is as much importance placed on whether the farmer has forgotten feeding time as where’s the best place to hide in a game of hide and seek.
In each adventure the Farmyard Bunch explore their friendships and role on the farm. They can be cheeky, often get up to mischief and find themselves in tricky situations. But as a foursome they always find a solution and learn something along the way.
And the Farmyard Bunch aren’t alone on the farm. There are the duck girls who live noisily on the pond; the gossipy Mrs Chickens; a very tall horse called Mack; a flock of wilful</desc>

The Lingo Show is a British flash animated children's television series created by Nicole Seymour, produced by the BBC and animated by Dinamo Productions for BBC's CBeebies channel and programming block. The show, which combines flash animation with live action footage, is designed to introduce pre-school children to new languages. The series, which initially began as an interactive minisite on the CBeebies website, began airing on CBeebies from March 12, 2012.
The series revolves around a show bug host named Lingo and his family of bugs, who each specialise in a different language. At the request of children, Lingo and his team travel around the UK to perform a Big Bug Show using one of their star performers. In each episode, the chosen bug searches around for props required for their act, introducing potential objects in their respective language, before bringing them back to Lingo so they can perform their Big Bug Show in front of the delighted preschool children.

Big Barn Farm is a live-action television series commissioned by Michael Carrington at the BBC, narrated by Ben Fairman in series 1 and Dave Lamb in series 2. The programmes are about four young animals, the Farmyard Bunch - Petal the piglet, Gobo the ‘kid’ goat, Dash the young donkey and Digger the puppy - and their view of life on Big Barn Farm. Their adventures on the farm revolve around their emotions and the situations they find themselves in. As the Farmyard Bunch explore the day to day routine of life on a farm, so they play, discover and have fun.
As the storylines are from the young animals’ point of view there is as much importance placed on whether the farmer has forgotten feeding time as where’s the best place to hide in a game of hide and seek.
In each adventure the Farmyard Bunch explore their friendships and role on the farm. They can be cheeky, often get up to mischief and find themselves in tricky situations. But as a foursome they always find a solution and learn something along the way.
And the Farmyard Bunch aren’t alone on the farm. There are the duck girls who live noisily on the pond; the gossipy Mrs Chickens; a very tall horse called Mack; a flock of wilful</desc>

ZingZillas is a television programme aimed at young children, broadcast on the BBC pre-school channel CBeebies.
ZingZillas is a music show aimed at the under sixes.
It is set on a monkey-shaped tropical island where everyone joins in to create music magic. They use musical influences from all over the globe from rock to soul, jazz to samba, big band to orchestra.
A yellow submarine is sometimes seen in the sea near the island. One episode contains what appears to be a view from the submarine through its periscope. In a recently-started 5-minute version called Zingzillas Zingbop, the submarine goes very near the viewpoint, showing children inside the submarine through its portholes; those children later take part in the programme's singing and dancing session, as if (in the world of the story) the submarine is the usual transport for guests to and from the island.
The main characters are primates: Zak, Tang, Panzee and the youngest, Drum. They are mentored by music guru DJ Loose and they create their unique ZingZilla sound just in time for their daily performance which is called 'The Big Zing'.

Gigglebiz is a children's television programme (a 'live action comedy sketch show') made in the UK. There have been two series, first broadcast on CBeebies , the BBC's younger children's channel, in 2009 and 2011.
The programme's star and creator is Justin Fletcher, who plays the chief characters in all the comic sketches. Some sketches are filmed in the studio; one regular external location is Portmeirion, used for the town of Wiggyville where the Captain Adorable sketches are set. The sketches are interspersed with 'Giggle Box' - film segments of children viewers telling Justin jokes.
The first series was broadcast in September 2009 and comprised 25 15-minute episodes. The second series of 15 episodes was shown in January 2011 (with a Christmas Special on Wednesday December 15, 2010). The new series saw some characters disappear to make way for new ones.
Scottish comedian Robert Florence auditioned for the show and was subsequently rejected.
All of these characters are played by Justin Fletcher

Freebase:
Grandpa In My Pocket is a comedy drama series commissioned by Michael Carrington for CBeebies, the BBC's dedicated pre-school and nursery channel targeting children under the age of 6 years. The programme stars James Bolam, Jay Ruckley, Josie Cable, Zara Ramm and Sam Ellis. The story centres on Grandpa (James Bolam), who owns a magical Shrinking Cap, which only his grandson Jason (Jay Ruckley) knows about. This cap enables him to shrink to about 4 or 5 inches tall and experience many magical adventures which are told via voice-over narration by Jason, including finding a hamster under the floorboards and bringing a home-made robot to life.
When miniaturized, he has enough magic power to make Jason's toy car and toy biplane and toy railway locomotive work as the real vehicles including making engine noise, and drive them. Jason has a simple toy glider made of two pieces of wood in the shape of a seagull which he calls Gordon; Grandpa, when miniaturized, can ride on this and make it fly like a real seagull.
When miniaturized, Grandpa can jump much farther in proportion than in full size, and can also "run for all he's worth", as Jason puts it.

64 Zoo Lane is a children's cartoon created by An Vrombaut.
It features a 7 year-old girl named Lucy who lives at 64 Zoo Lane, next door to a Zoo. Each night she is told a story by the animals present there. Characters include Georgina the Giraffe, Nelson the Elephant, Tickles and Giggles the Monkeys, Boris the Bear, and Molly the Hippopotamus. The cartoon emphasizes friendship and responsibility. At the story's end, friendly morals are discussed, then bed-time is declared. Georgina deposits Lucy into bed via the bedroom window (later episodes show Lucy yawning then sleeping soundly in bed; in the original episodes she would be lulled to sleep by the storytelling itself).
There are many opportunities for learning: exploring language and vocabulary are enhanced by the use of intonation and expression in the character's voices and the themes of the animals' stories support social and emotional issues, including friendships and helping and caring for others.
In the United Kingdom 64 Zoo Lane is shown on CBeebies, often as part of the lineup of the Bedtime Hour, and on Playhouse Disney. In the United States 64 Zoo Lane formerly aired on Nick Jr. at 1:00 AM &amp; 1:30 AM, but currently</desc>

Tikkabilla is a UK children's television programme, shown on BBC1, BBC2 and on the CBeebies channel.
The programme aims to educate pre-school children in an entertaining manner. The title "Tikkabilla" comes from the Punjabi word meaning "Hopscotch", a popular children's game. It was an exceptionally well loved childrens television show.
Each programme is introduced by two adults and a small dragon puppet named Tamba, whom resembles Spyro the Dragon in colouration. Tamba serves as the programme's naive child; the programme's educational content is introduced as the presenters explain things to Tamba. Whilst Tamba appears in every episode, a team of presenters take it in turns to pair-up in each show. These presenters include Justin Fletcher, Sarah-Jane Honeywell, Paul Ewing, Simon Davies, Lorna Laidlaw, Veejay Kaur, Toni Fruitin and Amit Sharma (both series 4 only) and Beverley Hills (series 1-3 only). Tamba is performed by puppeteers Sue Eves (series 1 - 4) who created the voice for Tamba; Alison McGowan (series 2 &amp; 3) and Katherine Smee (series 4).

It has also been shown for other countries, including North America (repeats formerly airing on PBS Kids Sprout).
It stars five creatures called Hoobs (Hubba Hubba, Iver, Groove, Tula, and Roma) from the fictional Hoobland, and their interactions with Earth and the human race. In each episode, they try to find the answer to a question to be put in the great Hoobopaedia created by Hubba Hubba, back in Hoobland, in hopes of learning all there is to know. Hubba Hubba remains in Hoobland to await the report from the other Hoobs; Iver, Groove, and Tula live in the Hoobmobile; and Roma travels to all parts of the world.

According to Jim is an American sitcom television series starring Jim Belushi in the title role as a suburban father of three children. It originally ran on ABC from October 3, 2001 to June 2, 2009.
Jim is an abrasive but lovable suburban father. Much like his real life counterpart, Jim's character is noted as a fan of blues music, as well as the Chicago Bears, Chicago Cubs, Chicago Bulls and the Chicago Blackhawks. Together with his wife Cheryl, whose middle name is Mabel, they have three children, daughters Ruby and Gracie and son Kyle. In the seventh season they become parents of a pair of twins Jonathan and Gordon.
Jim often finds himself in messy situations because his laziness inclines him to search for alternative ways of doing things with least effort. While Cheryl's brother Andy may be Jim's best friend, her sister Dana frequently teams up with Cheryl against Jim. He also prefers to lie to Cheryl and Dana to do his own activities but they end up backfiring on him. He hates losing to women (e.g. Hot Dog Eating Contests, Hamburger Eating Contests, Pizza Eating Contests, Pot Pie Eating Contests), especially if Cheryl or Dana find out. He doesn't like people interrupting him</desc>

The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series is a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle epitomized by its family of the same name, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture, society, television and many aspects of the human condition.
The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox, becoming the network's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989–1990).
Since its debut on December 17, 1989, the show has broadcast 508 episodes and the twenty-third season started airing on September 25, 2011. The Simpsons is the longest-running American sitcom, the longest-running American animated program, and in</desc>

Hollyoaks is a long-running British television soap opera, first broadcast on Channel 4 on 23 October 1995. It was originally devised by Phil Redmond, who has also devised shows including Brookside and Grange Hill. The programme is set in a fictional suburb of Chester called Hollyoaks and is centred around a local further education college called Hollyoaks Community College, with the characters generally being in their late teens or early twenties. Since 1995, the cast has expanded from just seven major characters to approximately 50 cast members. Since the long-serving producer Bryan Kirkwood quit in 2009, the role of series producer has seen several changes. Kirkwood's successor Lucy Allan stepped down from her position in 2010 after just twelve months, and her replacement, former The Bill producer Paul Marquess took control later that year. Like his predecessor, Marquess left the series after a year and Gareth Philips was appointed as series producer. Emma Smithwick later replaced Phillips as a permanent replacement. Smithwick was a series editor of the soap for a while, before taking on the role of producer in Autumn 2011.

Freebase:
Play Your Cards Right (or Bruce Forsyth's Play Your Cards Right) is a British television game show based on the American show known as Card Sharks. The gameplay was basically the same as in the American version.
Play Your Cards Right broadcast on ITV from 1980 to 1987, produced by London Weekend Television. The host was Bruce Forsyth. LWT produced a more modern version from 1994 to 1999, initially expected to be presented by Brian Conley who filmed a pilot show before Forsyth was lured back. In 2002, Bruce hosted another revival, with slightly modified rules. This version was produced by Thames Television. On 15 October 2005 it made a one-off return as part of Ant &amp; Dec's Gameshow Marathon, celebrating 50 years of ITV. It made another one-off return in 2007 again part of Gameshow Marathon. Forsyth also presented a parody of the format, Play Your Iraqi Cards Right (originally titled Play Your Kurds Right), when he was guest host on the satirical BBC TV series Have I Got News for You. Play Your Cards Right has also been turned into a successful Interactive DVD which was released in 2007, with an updated sequel released in 2008, both produced by DVDPro.

Freebase:
The Philippine version of 1 vs. 100 was first aired on ABS-CBN on August 25, 2007. It is hosted by veteran Filipino quiz host Edu Manzano, from Pilipinas, Game KNB?, and Weakest Link. A single player (The One) goes up against 100 other contestants (The Mob). The One gains money for each mob member eliminated, but if the One answers incorrectly at any point of the game, the game ends and he or she leaves with nothing. The grand prize of the show is P2,000,000.
The program is the fourth franchise the network acquired from its creator Endemol and it is also the most expensive, due to the studio's sheer size to accommodate the Mob.
The first season ended on April 19, 2008. Its run was supposed to have ended a long time ago, as the program revealed, but it was extended twice due to popular demand.
The Philippine version is similar to the US format (before its rules were reformatted) and the new European format used in Italy and France. Contestants are given multiple-choice questions with three possible answers. Either The One or the Mob (or its remaining members) can win the prize depending on whether The One can answer the questions correctly. After answering a question correctly, mob</desc>

Freebase:
Eggheads is a BBC quiz show created by 12 Yard Productions, first broadcast in 2003, and co-presented by Dermot Murnaghan and Jeremy Vine. For the 2008 series, Jeremy Vine was brought in to present on nights when Murnaghan was hosting the spinoff series Are You an Egghead? This happened again from October 2009 while Murnaghan presented the second series of the spinoff show. Since the spin-off show finished, Jeremy Vine has continued to host the second half of each series, which broadcasts 52 weeks a year. The show pits a team of five 'Eggheads' (made up from seven highly regarded quiz and game show champions, rotating each episode) against a series of teams of five 'challengers' who in each episode attempt to beat the Eggheads through a series of rounds. It is normally shown weekdays every week.
The title sequence consists of a voiceover by the host stating 'These people are amongst the greatest quiz players in Britain. Together they make up the Eggheads, arguably the most formidable quiz team in the country. The question is: can they be beaten?'

Pointless is a quiz show shown on BBC One, hosted by Alexander Armstrong, with Richard Osman as an assistant. It has been broadcast since 24 August 2009.
Similar to Family Fortunes, contestants must give answers to a question which had previously been asked to one hundred members of the public. However, there are important differences:
The object of the game is to score as few points as possible by giving correct answers that the public have or have not given, ultimately scoring lower than other contestants. The contestants particularly try to look for answers that score no points, which are known as "Pointless" answers. Finding a Pointless Answer adds £250 to the jackpot in rounds prior to the Final, and finding a Pointless Answer in the Final wins the game.
At the beginning of the show there are four teams (five in the first series) of two players. Any team which does not reach the final of the show on their first appearance is invited back for a second (and final) appearance on the next show.
The aim of the show is to get as few points as possible, by answering questions with lesser known correct answers.

Golden Balls was a British daytime game show on the ITV network, presented by Jasper Carrott, that aired from 18 June 2007 to 18 December 2009. It was filmed at the BBC Television Centre. From 25 February 2008 to 13 February 2009, the show was sponsored by ITV Bingo (powered by Party Gaming) (STV Bingo in Scotland); and from 2 November to 18 December 2009, the show was sponsored by Carpet Right. Golden Balls Ltd licensed their name to Endemol for the game show and merchandise.
At the back of the studio is the "Golden Bank", a giant contraption like a lottery machine. Inside it, are 100 golden balls, containing cash values, ranging from £10 to £75,000 (in the unaired pilot, the highest valued ball was £200,000 and £100,000 was also present). Twelve of these balls are randomly drawn from the machine and four "Killer" balls are added by Amanda Grant, the "Balls' Assistant". These sixteen balls are split equally and randomly among four contestants. Each contestant places two balls on his front row and two on his back row. The balls on the front row are visible to all contestants; the balls on the back row are visible only to their owner.

Brainiac: Science Abuse (often shortened to simply Brainiac) is a British entertainment TV show with a science motif. Numerous experiments are carried out in each show, often to verify whether common conceptions are true (such as whether it is possible to run across a pool of custard) or simply to create impressive explosions. The show centres on the three core branches of science for the key stages in British education: chemistry, physics and to a lesser extent, biology. The experimenters on the show are referred to as "Brainiacs", and each episode usually finishes with the destruction of a caravan.
The show is produced by ITV umbrella studios Granada Productions (collaboration between London Weekend Television and Granada Television in Manchester) and is broadcast in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland on Sky Digital.
The original presenters were Richard Hammond and Jon Tickle, then joined in the second series by Charlotte Hudson. Hammond left after the fourth, and was replaced by Vic Reeves and Hudson left after the fifth, and was replaced by Thaila Zucchi. The show's fifth series first aired on 8 May 2007 and the sixth, on 13 January 2008.

Takeshi's Castle (??!????, Fuun! Takeshi-jo, literally Showdown! Takeshi Castle) is a Japanese game show that aired between 1986 and 1989 on the Tokyo Broadcasting System. It featured the Japanese actor Takeshi Kitano (also known as Beat Takeshi) as a count who owns a castle and sets up difficult challenges for players (or a volunteer army) to get to him.

Each show finished with a "Final Showdown" in which Count Takeshi (Kitano) was faced by the remaining contestants. In early episodes they would storm the castle set itself in a short-range water gun assault. Later episodes introduced carts with paper rings, and eventually lasers and light-sensitive targets.

Distraction was a game show that aired on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom from 31 October 2003 to 11 June 2004. Presented by comedian Jimmy Carr, the show involves contestants answering questions, while being distracted in various bizarre, painful and humiliating ways.
Carr is aided by "distractors", who as the name suggests, attempt to distract the contestants painfully or emotionally. Examples include losing contestants, nudists, creepy carny guys, tattoo _ piercing experts, professional wrestlers, midgets, Roller Derby girls, professional hockey players, professional volleyball players, paintball players, and a large bouncer-type male nicknamed "Tiny". Occasionally, a number of female assistants helped with some of the distractions; depending on the stunt being played, they could be referred to as "Jimmy's interns", "farmer girls", "schoolgirls" or "ammo ladies."
A quiz book, featuring most of the distractions seen on the show, was released by Carlton Books in late 2004.

    <desc lang="en">In a game of truth and bluff, contestants try to find which of the 100 golden balls conceal life-changing amounts of cash and which contain the dreaded killer balls.
Freebase:
Golden Balls was a British daytime game show on the ITV network, presented by Jasper Carrott, that aired from 18 June 2007 to 18 December 2009. It was filmed at the BBC Television Centre. From 25 February 2008 to 13 February 2009, the show was sponsored by ITV Bingo (powered by Party Gaming) (STV Bingo in Scotland); and from 2 November to 18 December 2009, the show was sponsored by Carpet Right. Golden Balls Ltd licensed their name to Endemol for the game show and merchandise.
At the back of the studio is the "Golden Bank", a giant contraption like a lottery machine. Inside it, are 100 golden balls, containing cash values, ranging from £10 to £75,000 (in the unaired pilot, the highest valued ball was £200,000 and £100,000 was also present). Twelve of these balls are randomly drawn from the machine and four "Killer" balls are added by Amanda Grant, the "Balls' Assistant". These sixteen balls are split equally and randomly among four contestants. Each contestant places two balls on his front row and two on his back row. The balls on the front row are visible to all contestants; the balls on the back row are visible only to their owner.
Each contestant in turn announces the contents</desc>

Freebase:
It’s Not What You Know was a game show, hosted by Chris Tarrant, which aired on the British digital TV channel Challenge in 2008. The show was unusual as Challenge tends to air repeats of classic game shows that were originally commissioned by other broadcasters, very rarely producing original content.
The game is played by a team of two (friends, relatives, etc.). First of all, they are given three games to play: A, B or C. To help them, one celebrity "expert" and their specialist subject from each game is shown. The players must choose one of the games and, once they have, the other four celebrities and their specialist subjects in the chosen game are revealed. Each game contains 15 questions with each question being specific to one of the celebrity's specialist subject.
The first question comes up with four possible answers. The specialist celebrity did not receive the four options, the other celebrities did. We then see the correct answer (it does not matter if the players got it right or wrong). The players then have to decide on which celebrity they think got the question incorrect (in other words, which celebrity was "stumped"). There were at least four occasions of the</desc>

Swamp Loggers is an American reality television series on the Discovery Channel that follows the crew of Goodson's All Terrain Logging as they log the swamps of North Carolina (mostly in Pender County where much of the series is filmed).
Some of the running themes of the show include trying to get 100 loads of lumber shipped out per week, which gets the crew a bonus about 100 dollars and a BBQ paid for by Bobby and cooked by Dave (75 loads is generally considered the "break even" point where Bobby's expenses are covered), the constant difficulties encountered with bad weather, poor road conditions, and equipment failures. As well as uncertainties concerning lumber buyers, land owners (whose grounds that Goodson's is hired to work on), and saw mills.
Another issue that was featured during several episodes was the emergency gall bladder surgery performed on truck driver "Bo-Bo", the effect on his family and co-workers, and his recovery (he has since returned to Goodson's with a clean bill of health).</desc>

The series is screened by numerous international broadcasters, including Discovery Channel Australia, Discovery Channel Latin America, Discovery Channel Canada, Quest, SBS Australia, 7mate Australia and the Discovery Channel in the UK. The show's hosts, special effects experts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, use elements of the scientific method to test the validity of rumors, myths, movie scenes, adages, Internet videos, and news stories. The show is one of the oldest – and the most popular – on Discovery Channel currently in production, being preceded in the US only by How It's Made. In Canada, Daily Planet is older.
Filming is based in San Francisco, though some elements of production are done in Artarmon, Australia. Planning and some experimentation takes place at Hyneman's workshops in San Francisco; experiments requiring more space or special accommodations are filmed on location, typically around the San Francisco Bay area and other northern California places, going elsewhere when required, such as Florida for alligator experiments, or</desc>

It is filmed to simplify overdubbing in different languages. For example, the show avoids showing a narrator or host onscreen, does not often have employees of featured companies speak on camera, and keeps human interaction with the manufacturing process to a bare minimum. An offscreen narrator explains each process, sometimes making use of puns.

Meerkat Manor is a British television programme produced by Oxford Scientific Films for Animal Planet International that premiered in September 2005 and ran for four series until its cancellation in August 2008. Blending more traditional animal documentary style footage with dramatic narration, the series told the story of the Whiskers, one of more than a dozen families of meerkats in the Kalahari Desert being studied as part of the Kalahari Meerkat Project, a long-term field study into the ecological causes and evolutionary consequences of the cooperative nature of meerkats. The original programme was narrated by Bill Nighy, with the narration redubbed by Mike Goldman for the Australian airings and Sean Astin for the American broadcasts. The fourth series, subtitled The Next Generation, saw Stockard Channing replacing Astin as the narrator in the American dubbing.
Meerkat Manor premiered in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2005, and the first 13-episode series concluded on 24 October 2005. With the success of the programme in the United Kingdom, Animal Planet started broadcasting it on its national channels in Australia, Canada, and the US. It has since been rebroadcast in more</desc>

Good Luck Charlie is an original Disney Channel television sitcom, which premiered April 4, 2010. The series was created by Phil Baker and Drew Vaupen, who wanted to create a program that would appeal to entire families, as opposed to children only. It revolves around a Denver family, the Duncans, as they try to adjust to the birth of their fourth child, Charlotte "Charlie" Duncan (Mia Talerico). In each episode, Teddy Duncan (Bridgit Mendler) creates a video diary containing advice for Charlie about their family and life as a teenager. Teddy tries to show Charlie what she might go through when she is older in the video diaries for future reference. Each video diary ends with Teddy (or someone else from the family, even Charlie) saying the eponymous phrase, "Good luck, Charlie."
Among other decisions, executives included adult-centric scenes and changed the series title from Oops to Love, Teddy and finally to Good Luck Charlie in order to ensure the series would appeal to all family members. Good Luck Charlie premiered on Disney Channel in the United States on April 4, 2010. It premiered in Canada on April 5, 2010, the United Kingdom and Ireland on May 14, 2010, and in Australia</desc>

Phineas and Ferb is an American animated television comedy-musical series. Originally broadcast as a preview on August 17, 2007, and officially premiered on February 1, 2008 on Disney Channel, the series follows Phineas Flynn and his English stepbrother Ferb Fletcher on summer vacation. Every day, the boys embark on some grand new project, which annoys their controlling sister, Candace, who frequently tries to reveal their shenanigans to her and the boys' mother, Linda Flynn-Fletcher, and less frequently to their father, Lawrence Fletcher. The series follows a standard plot system; running gags occur every episode, and the B-Plot almost always features Perry the Platypus acting as a secret agent ("Agent P") for the OWCA (Organization Without a Cool Acronym), to fight an evil scientist named Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz. However, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, or Doof as he refers to himself, feels the need to assert his evilness. Sometimes, other villains scoff at his level of evil. The two plots intersect at the end to erase all traces of the boys' project just before Candace can show it to their mother. This usually leaves Candace very frustrated.

Art Attack is a British children's television series revolving around art. The original series was one of ITV's longest running programmes, running from 1990 to 2007, and was presented throughout by Neil Buchanan.
The new series launched on Disney Junior (UK &amp; Ireland) on 6 June 2011 and was presented by Jassa Ahluwalia. Each show involved Ahluwalia voicing-over footage of an artist producing three works of art, taking the viewer through the various stages of production step by step.
The show is hosted with different hosts from around the world.
Art Attack was the art programme described by Neil Buchanan that "Gives your eyeballs a shock!". This was because of the mad style of art usually done on the programme and to make art more fun for children. The art shown on the show was easy for children to follow and most 'Art Attacks' could be done using things found around the home. Buchanan very rarely used shop bought art materials.
The show was well known for quite often having messy Art Attacks, such as 'Plop Art' (dropping egg shells full of paint onto paper) and 'Splat attack!' (smashing paint soaked cotton wool balls on pieces of paper with fly swatters). Most messy art attacks</desc>

How to Be Indie was a Canadian television show on YTV. The main character is a 13 year old Indian Canadian teenager named Indira "Indie" Mehta. The program is a single-camera series intended for a youth audience. The series was created by Vera Santamaria, John May, and Suzanne Bolch. The series is currently airing its second season, and aired the final episode on October 24, 2011 on YTV in Canada and May 26, 2012 on Disney Channel in the UK.
The program follows Indie's journey as she tries to get the most out of life despite the travails of junior high school and her "strict" Indian parents. She is joined by her two best friends Marlon Parks and Abigail "Abi" Flores. She often falls into the trap of caring more about what her peers think of her than who she wants to be herself, and consequently spends a lot of time trying to impress her classmates. When not focussing on Indie, the show focusses on Marlon and Abi. A given episode will usually show Marlon's quirky antics getting him into a troublesome situation. Abi will have to help extricate him, which she willingly does, feeling pity on him. Sometimes, however, they swap roles as Marlon tries to play it cool.

Phineas and Ferb is an American animated television comedy-musical series. Originally broadcast as a preview on August 17, 2007, and officially premiered on February 1, 2008 on Disney Channel, the series follows Phineas Flynn and his English stepbrother Ferb Fletcher on summer vacation. Every day, the boys embark on some grand new project, which annoys their controlling sister, Candace, who frequently tries to reveal their shenanigans to her and the boys' mother, Linda Flynn-Fletcher, and less frequently to their father, Lawrence Fletcher. The series follows a standard plot system; running gags occur every episode, and the B-Plot almost always features Perry the Platypus acting as a secret agent ("Agent P") for the OWCA (Organization Without a Cool Acronym), to fight an evil scientist named Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz. However, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, or Doof as he refers to himself, feels the need to assert his evilness. Sometimes, other villains scoff at his level of evil. The two plots intersect at the end to erase all traces of the boys' project just before Candace can show it to their mother. This usually leaves Candace very frustrated.

Good Luck Charlie is an original Disney Channel television sitcom, which premiered April 4, 2010. The series was created by Phil Baker and Drew Vaupen, who wanted to create a program that would appeal to entire families, as opposed to children only. It revolves around a Denver family, the Duncans, as they try to adjust to the birth of their fourth child, Charlotte "Charlie" Duncan (Mia Talerico). In each episode, Teddy Duncan (Bridgit Mendler) creates a video diary containing advice for Charlie about their family and life as a teenager. Teddy tries to show Charlie what she might go through when she is older in the video diaries for future reference. Each video diary ends with Teddy (or someone else from the family, even Charlie) saying the eponymous phrase, "Good luck, Charlie."
Among other decisions, executives included adult-centric scenes and changed the series title from Oops to Love, Teddy and finally to Good Luck Charlie in order to ensure the series would appeal to all family members. Good Luck Charlie premiered on Disney Channel in the United States on April 4, 2010. It premiered in Canada on April 5, 2010, the United Kingdom and Ireland on May 14, 2010, and in Australia</desc>

One Tree Hill is an American television drama created by Mark Schwahn, which premiered on September 23, 2003, on The WB Television Network. After the series' third season, The WB merged with UPN to form The CW Television Network, and since September 27, 2006, the network has been the official broadcaster of the series in the United States.

Scrubs is an American medical comedy-drama television series which ran from October 2, 2001 to March 17, 2010 on NBC and ABC. The series, which follows the lives of employees at the fictional Sacred Heart teaching hospital, was created by Bill Lawrence. The title is a play on surgical scrubs and a term for a low-ranking person because at the beginning of the series, most of the main characters were medical interns.
The series features fast-paced screenplay, slapstick, and surreal vignettes presented mostly as the daydreams of the central character, Dr. John "J.D." Dorian, who is played by Zach Braff. Actors starring alongside Braff in the first eight seasons included Sarah Chalke, Donald Faison, Neil Flynn, Ken Jenkins, John C. McGinley and Judy Reyes. The series has also featured multiple guest appearances by film actors, such as Brendan Fraser, Heather Graham, and Colin Farrell.
In the ninth season, many new cast members were introduced and the show setting moved from a hospital to a medical school. Out of the original cast, only Braff, Faison and McGinley became regular cast members, while the others with the exception of Reyes, made guest appearances. Braff appeared in six</desc>

Charmed is an American television series that originally aired from October 7, 1998, until May 21, 2006, on the now defunct The WB Television Network. The series was created by writer Constance M. Burge and was produced by Aaron Spelling and his Spelling Television company, with the show runner being writer-director Brad Kern.
The series follows the four Halliwell sisters—Prue, Piper, Phoebe and, later on in the series, Paige (who replaces Prue from season 4 onwards). The sisters are the culmination of the most powerful line of good witches in history and are known as The Charmed Ones in the supernatural community, whose prophesized destiny is to protect innocent lives against evil beings such as demons and warlocks. Each sister possesses unique magical powers that grow and evolve, while they attempt to hold normal working lives in modern day San Francisco. Keeping their supernatural identities separate and secret from their ordinary lives often becomes a challenge for them, with the exposure of magic having far-reaching consequences on their various relationships and resulting in a number of police and FBI investigations throughout the series.

One Tree Hill is an American television drama created by Mark Schwahn, which premiered on September 23, 2003, on The WB Television Network. After the series' third season, The WB merged with UPN to form The CW Television Network, and since September 27, 2006, the network has been the official broadcaster of the series in the United States. The show is set in the fictional town of Tree Hill in North Carolina and originally follows the lives of two half-brothers, Lucas Scott (Chad Michael Murray) and Nathan Scott (James Lafferty), who compete for positions on their school's basketball team. Their relationship evolves from heartless enemies to caring brothers as the show progresses, and the drama that ensues from the brothers' romances with female characters and from the basketball atmosphere are significant elements within the series.
The first four seasons of the show focus on the main characters' lives through their high school years. With the beginning of the fifth season, Schwahn advanced the timeline by four years to show their lives after college, and he made it jump a further fourteen months from the end of the sixth to the start of the seventh season.

Hollyoaks is a long-running British television soap opera, first broadcast on Channel 4 on 23 October 1995. It was originally devised by Phil Redmond, who has also devised shows including Brookside and Grange Hill. The programme is set in a fictional suburb of Chester called Hollyoaks and is centred around a local further education college called Hollyoaks Community College, with the characters generally being in their late teens or early twenties. Since 1995, the cast has expanded from just seven major characters to approximately 50 cast members. Since the long-serving producer Bryan Kirkwood quit in 2009, the role of series producer has seen several changes. Kirkwood's successor Lucy Allan stepped down from her position in 2010 after just twelve months, and her replacement, former The Bill producer Paul Marquess took control later that year. Like his predecessor, Marquess left the series after a year and Gareth Philips was appointed as series producer. Emma Smithwick later replaced Phillips as a permanent replacement. Smithwick was a series editor of the soap for a while, before taking on the role of producer in Autumn 2011.

Actors starring alongside Braff in the first eight seasons included Sarah Chalke, Donald Faison, Neil Flynn, Ken Jenkins, John C. McGinley and Judy Reyes.

The Cleveland Show is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane, Mike Henry and Richard Appel for the Fox Broadcasting Company, as a spin-off from Family Guy.

The Big Bang Theory is an American sitcom created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, both of whom serve as executive producers on the show, along with Steven Molaro. All three also serve as head writers. It premiered on CBS on September 24, 2007.
The show is centered on five characters: roommates Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper, two physicists who work at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech); Penny, a blonde waitress and aspiring actress who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's equally geeky and socially awkward friends and co-workers aerospace engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Rajesh Koothrappali. The geekiness and intellect of the four guys is contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills and common sense. Three other supporting characters have also been promoted to starring roles: Leslie Winkle, a physicist colleague at Caltech and, at different times, a lover of both Leonard and Howard who left the show after season 3; Bernadette Rostenkowski, Howard's fiancée and now wife, who is a microbiologist and former part-time waitress alongside Penny; and Amy Farrah Fowler, a neuroscientist who joins the group after being matched to Sheldon</desc>

NCIS, formerly known as NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service, is an American police procedural drama television series revolving around a fictional team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which conducts criminal investigations involving the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.
The concept and characters were initially introduced in a two-part episode of the CBS series JAG (JAG episodes 8.20 and 8.21). The show, a spin-off from JAG, premiered on September 23, 2003 on CBS and, to date, has aired nine full seasons and has gone into syndicated reruns on USA Network, Cloo (formerly Sleuth), and Ion Television.

Zuiker and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. It is filmed primarily at Universal Studios in Universal City, California.
The series follows Las Vegas criminalists (identified as "Crime Scene Investigators" working for the Las Vegas Police Department (LVPD) instead of the actual title of "Crime Scene Analysts" and "Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department"(LVMPD)) as they use physical evidence to solve grisly murders in this unusually graphic drama, which has inspired a host of other cop-show "procedurals". The series mixes deduction, gritty subject matter and character-driven drama. The network later added spin-offs CSI: Miami and CSI: NY. On March 14, 2012, CBS renewed CSI for its 13th season.
CSI has been recognized as the most popular dramatic series internationally by the Festival de Télévision de Monte-Carlo, which has awarded it the "International Television Audience Award (Best Television Drama Series)" three times. CSI's worldwide audience was estimated to be over 73.8 million viewers in 2009.</desc>

Chuck is an action-comedy_spy-drama television program from the United States created by Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak. The series is about an "average computer-whiz-next-door" named Chuck, played by Zachary Levi, who receives an encoded e-mail from an old college friend now working for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); the message embeds the only remaining copy of the United States' greatest spy secrets into Chuck's brain.
Produced by College Hill Pictures, Fake Empire, Wonderland Sound and Vision and Warner Bros. Television, the series premiered on September 24, 2007, on NBC, airing on Monday nights at 8_7c.
As the second season closed, flagging ratings put Chuck in danger of cancellation, but fans mounted a successful campaign to encourage NBC to renew the show. The campaign was unique in that fans specifically targeted a sponsor of the show, the Subway restaurant chain, and the chain struck a major sponsorship deal with NBC to help cover costs of the third season. The series' renewal was uncertain in each subsequent season. The fifth season was the last; it began on October 28, 2011, moving to Friday nights at 8pm_7 Central.

Burn Notice is an American television series created by Matt Nix. The show stars Jeffrey Donovan, Gabrielle Anwar, Bruce Campbell, Sharon Gless, and, beginning in the fourth season, Coby Bell. The series premiered on June 28, 2007, on USA Network. On April 15, 2010, the show was renewed for its fifth and sixth seasons. The sixth season, set to include between 16 and 18 episodes, began on June 14, 2012.
The title of the series refers to the burn notices issued by intelligence agencies to discredit or announce the dismissal of agents or sources who are considered to have become unreliable. When spies are burned, their connection to an espionage organization is terminated, leaving them without access to cash or influence. According to the narration during the opening credits, the burned spy has no prior work history, no money, no support network – in essence, no identity. The television series uses first-person narrative (including frequent voice-overs providing exposition) from the viewpoint of covert-operations agent Michael Westen, played by Jeffrey Donovan. The voice-over commentary is in the form of tips for fledgling agents as if for a training or orientation film.

Neighbours is an Australian television soap opera. It was first broadcast on the Seven Network on 18 March 1985. It was created by TV executive Reg Watson, who proposed the idea of making a show that focused on realistic stories and portrayed adults and teenagers who talk openly and solve their problems together. Seven decided to commission the show following the success of Watson's Sons and Daughters, which aired on the network. Although successful in Melbourne, Neighbours underperformed in the Sydney market and struggled for months before Seven cancelled it. The show was immediately bought by rival network Ten. After taking over production of the show, the new network had to build replica sets because Seven destroyed the originals to prevent its rival from obtaining them. Ten began screening Neighbours on 20 January 1986, taking off where the previous series left off and commencing with episode 171. Neighbours has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and in 2005, it was inducted collectively into the Logie Hall of Fame. On 11 January 2011, Neighbours moved to Ten's new digital channel, Eleven.

It premiered in the United States on January 26, 1994 and ran for the intended five seasons. Describing it as having "always been conceived as, fundamentally, a five year story, a novel for television", Straczynski wrote 92 of the 110 episodes and served as executive producer, along with Douglas Netter.
Set between the years 2257 and 2262, it depicts a future where earth has sovereign states and a unifying Earthgov.

NCIS, formerly known as NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service, is an American police procedural drama television series revolving around a fictional team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which conducts criminal investigations involving the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.
The concept and characters were initially introduced in a two-part episode of the CBS series JAG (JAG episodes 8.20 and 8.21). The show, a spin-off from JAG, premiered on September 23, 2003 on CBS and, to date, has aired nine full seasons and has gone into syndicated reruns on USA Network, Cloo (formerly Sleuth), and Ion Television. Donald Bellisario, who created JAG as well as the well-known series Airwolf, Magnum, P.I., and Quantum Leap, is co-creator and executive producer of NCIS.
NCIS was originally referred to as Navy NCIS during season one; however, the word "Navy" was later dropped from the title as it was redundant. In season seven, NCIS was joined by a spin-off series, NCIS: Los Angeles, starring Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J.
In 2011, NCIS was voted as America’s favorite television show. On March 14, 2012, CBS renewed NCIS for a 10th season.

Family Guy is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the Griffins, a dysfunctional family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.
The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox on May 15, 1998. The show was given the green light and started production. Shortly after the third season of Family Guy aired in 2001, Fox canceled the series. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004.
Family Guy has been nominated for 12 Primetime Emmy Awards and 11 Annie Awards, and has won three of each. In 2009, it was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, the first</desc>

Loose Women is a British lunchtime television programme, first broadcast in 1999 on ITV. It consists of a panel of four women who interview celebrities and discuss topical issues, ranging from daily politics and current affairs, to celebrity gossip. Each series typically airs from the beginning of September of one year to the start of August of the next, while also taking a break over Christmas.
Due to a decline in ratings between January and June 2011, changes were made to the show upon the launch of its sixteenth series that September. Changes included a new lineup: anchor Kate Thornton and panellists Zoe Tyler and Coleen Nolan left the show, while new presenter Carol Vorderman and panellist Sally Lindsay both started on the programme.
The panel comprises four women from various professions in the entertainment and journalism industries, including actresses, singers, authors, presenters, journalists and reporters. Although all four women are classed as presenters in the credits, one acts as the main anchor, linking to breaks and competitions and addressing the television audience.

Dickinson's Real Deal is an ITV, UK modern antiques and collectables television programme presented by David Dickinson. It is broadcast on ITV1 as part of the afternoon schedule, and is repeated on sister channel ITV3.
The shows are recorded in venues in the United Kingdom. Members of the public are invited to bring their antiques and collectables along. Independent valuers put an estimate on how much they think the items are worth. This figure is revealed to the audience at home.
The items are then passed to the dealers, who make their own valuation and try to purchase them by placing a cash offer on the table. David Dickinson may step in and give some advice.
The seller then decides whether to accept or decline the deal. If the deal is declined items go to auction.
Dealers featured in the series have included; Alison Chapman, Cheryl Brown, Karen Dalmeny, Jo Brayshaw, Brenda Haller, Cheryl Hakeney, Tim Hogarth, Simon Schneider, Stewart Hofgartner, David Ford, Ian Towning, Mike Melody, David Hakeney, Michael Hogben, Clive Attrell, Rob Bingham, Monty English, James Layte, Alistair Lamont, David Tupman, George Baldwin, Helen Gardiner, Anna Rennie and Corrie Jeffrey.

The Alan Titchmarsh Show is a British daytime TV chat show broadcast between 3 and 4pm weekdays on the ITV Network.
The programme made its debut on ITV in 2007. It focused on the theme of "The Best of British" focusing on food, entertainment and celebrities in a mid-afternoon slot. The focus of the show later shifted towards gossip, entertainment and a light-hearted discussion of sex tips. The latter was toned down after viewer complaints and a shift to a late afternoon 5pm slot in 2010. The show usually opens with a review of gossip and current affairs stories of the day with regular guests including Gloria Hunniford, Carole Malone, Penny Smith, Nick Ferrari, Janet Street Porter, Jane McDonald and Emma Forbes offering their opinions. The programme resumes the studio debate format at half-past the hour with a "heated" discussion on the main "hot topic" of the day. The programme also includes regular cookery slots with Ainsley Harriot and Rosemary Shrager with Titchmarsh adopting a comical, "hands-on" role as a hopeless cookery assistant. In Shrager's cookery demonstrations, the pair often alternate between bickering and flirting with visual "humour" and numerous double entendres</desc>

Coronation Street is a British television soap opera set in Weatherfield, a fictional town in Greater Manchester based on Salford. Created by Tony Warren, Coronation Street was first broadcast on 9 December 1960. The show has been on the air for over 51 years. Coronation Street is produced by ITV Granada Television under ITV Studios and shown in all ITV regions. It has been filmed in Manchester at the Granada Studios since inception, but filming will move to a new set at Media City in Trafford in 2013.
Since first being aired, it has been one of the most financially lucrative programmes on British commercial television, underpinning the success of its broadcaster ITV and its franchise Granada Television. On 17 September 2010, it became the world's longest-running TV soap opera in production, after the United States soap opera As the World Turns ended.
The first episode was aired on 9 December 1960 and was not initially a critical success; Daily Mirror columnist Ken Iriwin claimed the series would only last three weeks. Granada Television commissioned only 13 episodes and some inside the company doubted the show would last its planned production run. Despite the criticism, viewers</desc>

ITV Nightscreen is a scheduled programme on the United Kingdom's ITV television network, consisting of a sequence of animated pages of information about ITV's upcoming programmes, features and special events, with an easy listening music soundtrack. The programme is used to fill the station's overnight downtime, where a closedown would have once been used at the end of programmes. Previously it began after the final programme in the night and finishes at 05:30 every day, but recently ITV have started airing The Jeremy Kyle Show at 4:30am-5:30am, giving Nightscreen a shorter airtime with it starting usually at around 3:15-3:45 and finishing at 4:30.
It was first broadcast in 1998, and consisted of teletext pages taken from the ITV regional teletext services, with interstitial teletext-based animations in a similar style to the former 4-Tel On View, which had also been produced by the Intelfax). Since 2003 the screens have been produced using Scala InfoChannel3. In early 2009, updated systems were installed with the latest version of Scala5, with a dual redundant system to counter any issues of service.

Maury (sometimes known as The Maury Povich Show) is a syndicated American tabloid talk show hosted by Maury Povich.
When the series first aired in 1991, the show was called The Maury Povich Show and was produced by MoPo Productions in association with Paramount Domestic Television. The show adopted the title Maury in the 1995–1996 season. The show was then revamped in the 1998–1999 season, when Studios USA (now NBCUniversal) took over production. However, MoPo continues to co-produce with NBCUniversal. For the series' first 18 seasons, it was taped in New York City, but beginning with Season 19, the show has been taped in the Stamford Media Center in Stamford, Connecticut. Maury is one of four NBC Universal syndicated properties to make the move to Connecticut, joining the former Chicago-based Jerry Springer and Steve Wilkos shows. (The fourth, the syndicated Deal or No Deal, is no longer in production.) But the TV rating on Maury has been rated TV-G, TV-PG, and TV-14 on the syndicated stations of the United States, based on each episode's content.
Maury has dealt with a variety of issues across its 21 seasons, including – but not limited to – teenage pregnancy, sexual infidelity,</desc>

Geordie Shore is a reality television series, broadcast by MTV (UK and Ireland). Set in and around Newcastle upon Tyne and places such as Whitley Bay, Sunderland and South Shields, it is the British adaptation of American show Jersey Shore. The first episode aired on 24 May 2011. Geordie Shore is the first official adaptation from the American version. The first series was heavily publicised before its release and after its success, a two-part Magaluf Madness special was commissioned. Series 2 was announced on 7 December 2011 and ran for 8 episodes, viewing figures still held up strong and a third series was commissioned and has been filmed in Cancun, Mexico. A fourth series was also commissioned on 24 May 2012.
Although often compared to its contemporary reality shows The Only Way is Essex and Made in Chelsea, Geordie Shore is thought to be much less of a 'structured reality'. The events are presented more like a documentary and production forgoes the glossy, soap like style the previous programmes adopt. Members of crew can be seen to intervene when scenes on Geordie Shore are getting out of hand and this all enhances its reputation as Britain's most shocking reality</desc>

Renford Rejects was a teen sitcom produced and broadcast by Nickelodeon UK between 1998 and 2001. The show briefly aired in the United States on Nick GaS.
The show concerned a five-a-side school football team, made up of aspiring players who had been turned down by their school's main team. They were named "Renford Rejects" when a rival player sabotaged their league entry form, but decided to stick with the name as it suited their "outcast" nature.
Series 1 was filmed in Autumn 1997, Series 2 in Autumn 1998, Series 3 in Autumn 1999, and Series 4 in Autumn 2000.
The show was filmed at Willesden Sports Centre, London, NW10 3QX. Eddie McAvoy's Gracelands Cafe was filmed at 118 College Road, Willesden, London NW10 5HD.
The 'Cafe' still exists to this current day.
The regular cast, as is often the case with teen sitcoms, went through a number of changes as its four series went by; however, characters who remained throughout the run included :
In the first two series, the team were coached by Stewart Jackson (Matthew Leitch), an upper-class older boy who had been the school team's star player until an injury (caused by Terry Stoker) prevented him from playing. He supports Chelsea and</desc>

Winx Club is a 2004 Italian animated television series, created by Iginio Straffi and produced by Rainbow S.r.l.. The series is aimed toward children between the ages of five and twelve, but is also popular among teens. It has spawned an international franchise of toys, books, clothing, video games, DVDs, as well as two CGI feature films.
Apart from the English language version of the series done by Cinélume in Canada for various international markets, 4Kids Entertainment in the United States made an alternative version by changing dialogue and music and altering some visuals and situations. Their dub was discontinued in 2007 after the third season. In 2011, Nickelodeon aired four one-hour specials that summarizes seasons one and two, as well as airing seasons 3 and 4 in full complete seasons.
Iginio Straffi first wished to create a show aimed mainly at girls like Sailor Moon in 2000, when children's programming was dominated by boy-oriented shows.
The story follows Bloom and her friends Stella, Flora, Techna, Musa, Layla (Aisha), and is situated mainly in the Magical Dimension and on Earth. They call themselves "The Winx Club" and go on countless adventures together. Throughout</desc>

Scrubs is an American medical comedy-drama television series which ran from October 2, 2001 to March 17, 2010 on NBC and ABC. The series, which follows the lives of employees at the fictional Sacred Heart teaching hospital, was created by Bill Lawrence. The title is a play on surgical scrubs and a term for a low-ranking person because at the beginning of the series, most of the main characters were medical interns.
The series features fast-paced screenplay, slapstick, and surreal vignettes presented mostly as the daydreams of the central character, Dr. John "J.D." Dorian, who is played by Zach Braff. Actors starring alongside Braff in the first eight seasons included Sarah Chalke, Donald Faison, Neil Flynn, Ken Jenkins, John C. McGinley and Judy Reyes. The series has also featured multiple guest appearances by film actors, such as Brendan Fraser, Heather Graham, and Colin Farrell.
In the ninth season, many new cast members were introduced and the show setting moved from a hospital to a medical school. Out of the original cast, only Braff, Faison and McGinley became regular cast members, while the others with the exception of Reyes, made guest appearances. Braff appeared in six</desc>

South Park is an American animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone for the Comedy Central television network. Intended for mature audiences, the show has become famous for its crude language and dark, surreal humor that lampoons a wide range of topics. The ongoing narrative revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick—and their bizarre adventures in and around the titular Colorado town.
Parker and Stone, who met at college, developed the show from two animated shorts they created in 1992 and 1995. The latter became one of the first Internet viral videos, which ultimately led to its production as a series. South Park debuted in August 1997 with great success, consistently earning the highest ratings of any basic cable program. Subsequent ratings have varied but it remains one of Comedy Central's highest rated shows. It is Comedy Central's longest running program; a total of 230 episodes have aired, and the series is slated to run through at least 2016.

Two and a Half Men is an American television sitcom that premiered on CBS on September 22, 2003. Starring Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer, and Angus T. Jones, the show was originally about a hedonistic jingle writer, Charlie Harper; his uptight brother, Alan; and Alan's growing son, Jake. Charlie's free-wheeling life is complicated when his brother gets divorced and moves, along with his son, into Charlie's beach-front Malibu house. The series' premise was revamped in the ninth season, focusing on Alan moving on with his life after the death of Charlie with help from his new best friend and housemate, Walden Schmidt (Ashton Kutcher), who is also dealing with his own troubles following a bad divorce. Alan, Walden, and Jake eventually bond, becoming close friends, forming a surrogate family unit.
In 2010, CBS and Warner Bros. Television reached a multi-year broadcast agreement for the series, renewing it through at least the 2011_12 season. However, on February 24, 2011, CBS and Warner Bros. decided to end production for the rest of the eighth season due to Sheen entering drug rehabilitation and making "disparaging comments" about the show's creator and executive producer, Chuck Lorre.</desc>

Two and a Half Men is an American television sitcom that premiered on CBS on September 22, 2003. Starring Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer, and Angus T. Jones, the show was originally about a hedonistic jingle writer, Charlie Harper; his uptight brother, Alan; and Alan's growing son, Jake. Charlie's free-wheeling life is complicated when his brother gets divorced and moves, along with his son, into Charlie's beach-front Malibu house. The series' premise was revamped in the ninth season, focusing on Alan moving on with his life after the death of Charlie with help from his new best friend and housemate, Walden Schmidt (Ashton Kutcher), who is also dealing with his own troubles following a bad divorce. Alan, Walden, and Jake eventually bond, becoming close friends, forming a surrogate family unit.
In 2010, CBS and Warner Bros. Television reached a multi-year broadcast agreement for the series, renewing it through at least the 2011_12 season. However, on February 24, 2011, CBS and Warner Bros. decided to end production for the rest of the eighth season due to Sheen entering drug rehabilitation and making "disparaging comments" about the show's creator and executive producer, Chuck Lorre.</desc>

South Park is an American animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone for the Comedy Central television network. Intended for mature audiences, the show has become famous for its crude language and dark, surreal humor that lampoons a wide range of topics. The ongoing narrative revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick—and their bizarre adventures in and around the titular Colorado town.
Parker and Stone, who met at college, developed the show from two animated shorts they created in 1992 and 1995. The latter became one of the first Internet viral videos, which ultimately led to its production as a series. South Park debuted in August 1997 with great success, consistently earning the highest ratings of any basic cable program. Subsequent ratings have varied but it remains one of Comedy Central's highest rated shows. It is Comedy Central's longest running program; a total of 230 episodes have aired, and the series is slated to run through at least 2016.

Ffeil (File) is a Welsh-language television news programme for children and young people, produced by BBC Cymru Wales for S4C.
Originally aired three times a week for 15 minutes (except during school summer holidays), Ffeil was later broadcast live for four and a half minutes every weekday afternoon throughout the year at 4:50pm, from the BBC's Broadcasting House in Llandaff, Cardiff. The programme was transmitted from Studio C2, the second largest studio in Broadcasting House. Following a re-launch in Spring 2012, Ffeil is now broadcast from Monday to Thursday from a virtual reality studio at 6.20pm. A reporter is also based at the BBC's North Wales newsroom in Bangor.
Although the programme has been compared greatly to its English-language counterpart, CBBC's Newsround, Ffeil differs in that it's produced directly by BBC Cymru's news and current affairs department (whereas Newsround is produced by CBBC with facilities provided by BBC News). The programme also has an expanded brief to cover Welsh regional news and features, alongside national and international news. The reporters and presenters on Ffeil also regularly contribute to news coverage on BBC Radio Cymru and the nightly</desc>

Rownd a Rownd (English: "Round and Round") is a soap opera broadcast on Welsh television channel S4C. It was the first Welsh-language soap specifically directed at a youth audience.
It was originally based on young people who did a paper round (hence the programme's title, based on the wheels of a bicycle), but has since grown to include both their daily school and family life. Phil Redmond, creator of Grange Hill, Brookside and Hollyoaks, acted as a consultant to the series on its launch in 1995, and again on its tenth anniversary.
The series is filmed in Menai Bridge, Anglesey. When it began the production company, Nant Films (now Rondo Media), converted a disused garage in Dale Street (Welsh name: "Lon Cilbedlam") into a fake row of shops, which include a café, a hairdresser, a newsagent and a taxi firm. There is a sign outside this set informing the public that the shops are not real. School scenes are filmed in the town's two schools, Ysgol y Borth and Ysgol David Hughes. Hospital scenes are often filmed in nearby Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor, usually in one of the staff hostels.
The series finale involved the Hardy family kicked out of their homes, Barry two-timing and leaving both</desc>

Pobol y Cwm (People of the Valley) is a Welsh-language television soap opera which has been produced by the BBC since October 1974. The longest-running television soap opera produced by the BBC, Pobol y Cwm was originally transmitted on BBC Wales television and later transferred to the Welsh-language station S4C when it opened in November 1982.
Rugby specials apart, Pobol y Cwm is consistently the most watched programme of the week on S4C, and in 1994 was briefly shown in the rest of the UK on BBC2 with English subtitles. Five episodes are produced each week, normally broadcast at 20.00 every weeknight, with a repeat (subtitled in English) shown at 18.30 on the following weekday evening. An omnibus edition (also subtitled) is shown on Sunday afternoons.
The setting for the show is the (fictional) village of Cwmderi, located in the (real) Gwendraeth Valley – an area lying between Carmarthen and Llanelli in south-west Wales. By no means all of the cast speak with local, Carmarthenshire accents, however. Indeed, the fact that there are "incomers" from other Welsh-speaking parts of Wales in the village is one of the programme's features. Much of the activity centres on the village pub,</desc>

Smallville is an American television series developed by writers_producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. It is based on the DC Comics character Superman, originally created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. The television series was initially broadcast by The WB Television Network (The WB), premiering on October 16, 2001. After Smallville's fifth season, The WB and UPN merged to form The CW Television Network, which became the broadcaster for the show in the United States. It ended its tenth and final season on May 13, 2011. The series follows the adventures of Clark Kent (Tom Welling), who resides in the fictional town of Smallville, Kansas, during the years before he becomes Superman. The first four seasons focus on Clark and his friends' high school years. After season five, the show ventured into more adult settings, eventually focusing on his career at the Daily Planet, as well as introducing other DC comic book superheroes and villains.

Buffy the Vampire Slayer is an American television series that aired from March 10, 1997, until May 20, 2003. The series was created in 1997 by writer-director Joss Whedon under his production tag, Mutant Enemy Productions with later co-executive producers being Jane Espenson, David Fury, David Greenwalt, Doug Petrie, Marti Noxon, and David Solomon. The series narrative follows Buffy Summers (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar), the latest in a line of young women known as "Vampire Slayers" or simply "Slayers". In the story, Slayers are "called" (chosen by fate) to battle against vampires, demons, and other forces of darkness. Like previous Slayers, Buffy is aided by a Watcher, who guides, teaches, and trains her. Unlike her predecessors, Buffy surrounds herself with a circle of loyal friends who become known as the "Scooby Gang".
The series received critical and popular acclaim and usually reached between four and six million viewers on original airings. Although such ratings are lower than successful shows on the "big four" networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox), they were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB Television Network.

Star Trek: The Next Generation (often abbreviated to TNG) is an American science fiction television series created by Gene Roddenberry as part of the Star Trek franchise. Roddenberry, Rick Berman, and Michael Piller served as executive producers at different times throughout the production. The show was created 21 years after the original Star Trek show and set in the 24th century from the year 2364 through 2370 (about 100 years after the original series timeframe). The program features a new crew and a new starship Enterprise. Patrick Stewart's voice-over introduction during each episode's opening credits stated the starship's purpose, updated from the original to represent an open-ended "mission", and to be gender- (and even species-) neutral:
It premiered the week of September 28, 1987 to 27 million viewers with the two-hour pilot "Encounter at Farpoint". With 178 episodes spread over seven seasons, it ran longer than any other Star Trek series, ending with the two-hour finale "All Good Things..." the week of May 23, 1994.

The series is broadcast in the United States on the cable channel Syfy and is a co-production between BermanBraun and Universal Cable Productions. It premiered on July 11, 2011.

The series follows five people, known as "Alphas", led by noted neurologist and psychologist Dr. Lee Rosen as they investigate criminal cases involving other suspected Alphas. Rosen and his team of Alphas operate under the auspices of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the criminal investigative arm of the U.S. Department of Defense. While investigating these crimes, it does not take the team too long to discover that a group known as "Red Flag", which was thought defeated and eliminated long ago, is using other Alphas to commit crimes.

Star Trek: The Next Generation (often abbreviated to TNG) is an American science fiction television series created by Gene Roddenberry as part of the Star Trek franchise.

Freebase:
The Cat in the Hat is an animated musical television special first aired on CBS on March 10, 1971, based on the 1957 Dr. Seuss children's book of the same name, and produced by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises. With voices by Allan Sherman and prolific vocal performer Daws Butler, this half-hour special is a loose adaptation with added musical sequences.
The plot of the special differs significantly from the original book. The sequence in the book where the cat balances all sorts of objects on a ball, then crashes, is left out. Also differing is the role of Thing 1 and Thing 2; in the original book, they were simply things the cat brought along to demonstrate fun, but in this special, they are commissioned to help find the cat's "moss-covered three-handled family gradunza." Also that the fish never joined in with what the cat is up to at the end, nor was his given name, if he had one, ever revealed. The vocabulary used in the special is also of a much higher level than the book, though still in Seuss's trademark rhyme.
After the Cat makes his entrance and fools around a bit, the Fish requests that he leave. He does so, but then comes back in, claiming that his "moss-covered</desc>

Freebase:
The Help is an American situation comedy television series which premiered on The WB on March 5, 2004. The show was a raunchy comedy that focused on the hard-lucked life of a beauty school dropout, who now must work for the wealthy and spoiled Ridgeway family. The rest of the hired help are also very unusual in their own ways. The WB only aired seven episodes, the show ending on April 16, 2004, and canceled it in May 2004.
Maria is studying to be a beautician when she has to come home and nurse her sick mother. After her mother's death, Maria is forced to take her place as the wealthy Ridgeway family's maid. She soon discovers not only a class struggle between the Ridgeways and the help, but also an all-out war among the servants.
The premiere of The Help was the most watched program in the Friday 9:30-10:00 time slot on The WB in the 2003-04 season. The premiere was more popular among women than men aged 12–34 (2.0_8 versus 1.3_5).
Despite the premiere being the best performance in the time slot of the season on The WB the critics have nothing positive to say. Virginia Heffernan of The New York Times said the show "comes off like a school play, clumsily blocked, loudly acted and</desc>

Raised on the streets of turn-of-the century London, orphaned Peter and his pals survive by their fearless wits as cunning young pickpockets. Now, they've been rounded up by their mentor Jimmy Hook to snatch a priceless, some believe, magical treasure which transports them to another world. Neverland is a realm of white jungles and legendary mysteries of eternal youth, where unknown friends and enemies snatched from time welcome the new travelers with both excitement and trepidation. These groups include a band of 18th century pirates led by the power-mad Elizabeth Bonny, and the Native American Kaw tribe led by a Holy Man, which has protected the secret of the tree spirits from Bonny and her gang for ages, and that has meant war. But as the fight to save this strange and beautiful world becomes vital, Hook, Peter, and the ragamuffin lost boys consider that growing old somewhere in time could be less important than growing up, right here in their new home called Neverland.</desc>

Rango was a Western situation comedy starring comedian Tim Conway which was broadcast in the United States on the ABC television network in 1967.
In Rango, Conway played an inept Texas Ranger who had been assigned to the quietest post the Rangers had, Deep Wells, so as to keep him from creating unnecessary trouble. The Rangers apparently would have like to have removed him from the service altogether but were prevented from doing so by the fact that his father was their commander. But he seemed to bring his own trouble with him, as crime suddenly returned to a place that had seen very little of it the prior 20 years.
Also appearing in Rango was the American Indian character Pink Cloud (Guy Marks), an overly-assimilated Indian who was very fond of the ways of the whites and whose command of the English language was generally better than theirs. (Example: "Rango say him return when sun high over teepee. By that, I presume he meant that he would be back by noon.")
The theme song co-written by Earle Hagen and sung by Frankie Laine. The series ran for less than a year.

13 Assassins (??????, Jusannin no Shikaku) is a 2010 Japanese-British jidaigeki film directed by Takashi Miike.
A samurai epic with a loose historical basis, the film was produced by Toshiaki Nakazawa, who also produced the 2009 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film Departures. Jeremy Thomas, the film's executive producer, has a reputation for successfully bringing Asian titles into the international market, most notably Bernardo Bertolucci's nine-time Oscar winner The Last Emperor, Nagisa Ôshima's Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence and Takeshi Kitano's Brother.
The film is a remake of Eiichi Kudo’s 1963 black-and-white Japanese film of the same name, Jûsan-nin no shikaku. The screenplay was written by Daisuke Tengan.
The film stars Koji Yakusho, whose credits include Memoirs of a Geisha and Shall We Dance, along with Takayuki Yamada, Hiroki Matsukata, and Kazuki Namioka.
It was nominated for Best Film at the 34th Japan Academy Prize.
It is the third film in which Yamada and Takaoka co-starred, the first two being Crows Zero and Crows Zero 2, both directed by Miike.

Beetlejuice is an American-Canadian animated television series which ran from September 9, 1989 to October 26, 1991 on ABC and, on Fox from September 9, 1991 to May 7, 1998. Loosely based on the 1988 film of the same name, it was developed and executive-produced by the film's director, Tim Burton. The series focus on the life of Goth girl Lydia Deetz and her undead friend Beetlejuice as they explore the world, called The Neitherworld, a wacky afterlife realm inhabited by monsters, ghosts, ghouls and zombies. Danny Elfman's theme for the film was arranged for the cartoon by Elfman himself.
The premise of the animated series was greatly changed from the film, to the point where one only superficially resembled the other. In the film, Beetlejuice was the antagonist, who ended up nearly marrying a disgusted Lydia; in the series, they are best friends, and Lydia, something of a social misfit in the living world, frequently visits him in the afterlife during her free time. The Maitlands, the most significant characters in the film, are nowhere to be found in the series. And unlike the mind-numbing bureaucracy that is in the movie, the afterlife was converted into "the Neitherworld", a</desc>

Beetlejuice is an American-Canadian animated television series which ran from September 9, 1989 to October 26, 1991 on ABC and, on Fox from September 9, 1991 to May 7, 1998. Loosely based on the 1988 film of the same name, it was developed and executive-produced by the film's director, Tim Burton. The series focus on the life of Goth girl Lydia Deetz and her undead friend Beetlejuice as they explore the world, called The Neitherworld, a wacky afterlife realm inhabited by monsters, ghosts, ghouls and zombies. Danny Elfman's theme for the film was arranged for the cartoon by Elfman himself.
The premise of the animated series was greatly changed from the film, to the point where one only superficially resembled the other. In the film, Beetlejuice was the antagonist, who ended up nearly marrying a disgusted Lydia; in the series, they are best friends, and Lydia, something of a social misfit in the living world, frequently visits him in the afterlife during her free time. The Maitlands, the most significant characters in the film, are nowhere to be found in the series. And unlike the mind-numbing bureaucracy that is in the movie, the afterlife was converted into "the Neitherworld", a</desc>

Freebase:
Silent Witness is a crime thriller series, produced for the BBC, focusing on a team of forensic pathology experts and their investigations into various crimes. First broadcast in 1996, and still airing as of the present day, the series was created by Nigel McCrery, a former murder squad detective based in Nottingham. He later went on to create the hit series New Tricks, with writer Roy Mitchell.
The original series was based on Professor Helen Witwell, a forensic pathologist based in Sheffield, whom McCrery had known while serving as a police officer. The programme originally followed the activities of a female pathologist, Professor Sam Ryan, played by Amanda Burton. However, Ryan's character departed early in the eighth series in 2004. There had been a succession of regular supporting characters, changing almost every series, but Dr Leo Dalton (William Gaminara) and Dr Harry Cunningham (Tom Ward), who were introduced in the sixth series in 2002, remained in the series and continued as lead characters following Ryan's departure, with Dalton replacing her as professor. A new character, Dr Nikki Alexander (Emilia Fox), was introduced to the team in the eighth series in 2004. While</desc>

Freebase:
Jeff Randall Live is a business programme which is broadcast on Sky News in the United Kingdom at 19:00 from Monday to Thursday. It began on 24 September 2007 as a weekly show, and is hosted by the business journalist Jeff Randall. The show features interviews with some of the UK's leading business, financial and political figures, with past guests including the billionaire tycoon Philip Green, and former Chancellor Alistair Darling.
In January 2009, Jeff Randall joined Sky News on a permanent basis with the programme becoming part of the daily schedule instead of its previous weekly status when it only aired on a Monday.
In September 2010, Jeff Randall Live was extended to a one-hour slot Monday-Thursday, this follows the axing of SkyNews.com, which until then aired in the previous 30 minute slot.
At the end of February 2010, Jeff Randall Live moved to a new studio in the City of London at 30 St Mary Axe, better known as "The Gherkin". Special programmes like the budget and other business related programmes will also be broadcast from the new studio.
Following the announcement of the 2010 General Election, Jeff Randall Live was incorporated into an hour long show - Boulton &amp;</desc>

Freebase:
Sky News at Ten is a long-running daily news show on Sky News, airing between 10:00pm and 11:00pm (including Sportsline at 10:45pm). From Monday to Thursday, the show is presented by Anna Botting whilst Friday to Sunday Mark Longhurst fronts the programme.
The show was originally launched in 1999 following the move of ITV's News at Ten. At this time, the show used its own special version of the Sky News graphics and a unique mix of the Sky News Music.
Over the years, the show has been presented by many of Sky's presenters although between 2002 and October 2005, the show had no set presenters, with a group of five or six rotating the duties. These included Chris Roberts, Vivien Creegor, Stephen Dixon, Allan King, Emma Crosby, and Martin Popplewell.
In May 2010, Sky News at Ten began to air in the United States on the Fox Soccer Channel cable network at 2am Eastern Time until the start of the European season in August, mainly because of the programme's comprehensive look at the sports of the day and to reduce conflicts with ESPN due to sister network Sky Sports News usually airing at that time. The substitution of Sky News at Ten was purposeful, as Fox Soccer Channel was disallowed</desc>

Brainiac: Science Abuse (often shortened to simply Brainiac) is a British entertainment TV show with a science motif. Numerous experiments are carried out in each show, often to verify whether common conceptions are true (such as whether it is possible to run across a pool of custard) or simply to create impressive explosions. The show centres on the three core branches of science for the key stages in British education: chemistry, physics and to a lesser extent, biology. The experimenters on the show are referred to as "Brainiacs", and each episode usually finishes with the destruction of a caravan.
The show is produced by ITV umbrella studios Granada Productions (collaboration between London Weekend Television and Granada Television in Manchester) and is broadcast in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland on Sky Digital.
The original presenters were Richard Hammond and Jon Tickle, then joined in the second series by Charlotte Hudson. Hammond left after the fourth, and was replaced by Vic Reeves and Hudson left after the fifth, and was replaced by Thaila Zucchi. The show's fifth series first aired on 8 May 2007 and the sixth, on 13 January 2008.

Dog the Bounty Hunter is a reality television show on A&amp;E which chronicles Duane "Dog" Chapman's adventures as a fugitive recovery agent, or bounty hunter. With a few exceptions, the show takes place in Hawaii or Dog's home state of Colorado.
After eight seasons, on May 21, 2012 A&amp;E cancelled the series.
Duane "Dog" Chapman is joined by his business partner and wife, Beth Chapman; his grown sons Duane Lee Chapman, II and Leland Chapman, and his "brother," Tim "Youngblood" Chapman (despite having the same last name, Chapman and Tim are not biologically related). In Season 2, Dog's teenage daughter, "Baby" Lyssa Chapman returns home and becomes a member of the bounty-hunting team. Justin Bihag (son of longtime family friend Moon Bihag) also helps out during Season 1 and occasionally later.
The program spun off from Chapman's appearance on the show Take This Job, a program about people with unusual occupations. Both shows are produced for A&amp;E by Hybrid Films, a New York-based production company. Dog the Bounty Hunter captured an audience immediately by drawing viewers into the interaction of Chapman and his family_team, mixing street smarts, romance, arguments, teamwork,</desc>

Futurama is an American animated science fiction comedy sitcom created by Matt Groening and developed by Groening and David X. Cohen for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series follows the adventures of a late-20th-century New York City pizza delivery boy, Philip J. Fry, who, after being unwittingly cryogenically frozen for one thousand years, finds employment at Planet Express, an interplanetary delivery company in the retro-futuristic 31st century. The series was envisioned by Groening in the late 1990s while working on The Simpsons, later bringing Cohen aboard to develop storylines and characters to pitch the show to Fox.
In the United States, the series aired on Fox from March 28, 1999 to August 10, 2003 before ceasing production. Futurama was then aired in reruns on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim from 2003 to 2007, until the network's contract expired.

Fringe is an American science fiction television series created by J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci. It premiered on the Fox Broadcasting network on September 9, 2008. The series follows Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), and Walter Bishop (John Noble), members of a Federal Bureau of Investigation "Fringe Division" team based in Boston, Massachusetts under the supervision of Homeland Security. The team uses "fringe" science and FBI investigative techniques to investigate a series of unexplained, often ghastly occurrences, which are related to mysteries surrounding a parallel universe. The series has been described as a hybrid of The X-Files, Altered States and The Twilight Zone.
The series' format combines elements from procedural dramas as well as those found in serials. The series began as a more traditional "mystery of the week" series, and became more serialized in later seasons. A majority of episodes contain a standalone plot, with several episodes also exploring the series' overarching mythology.

Road Wars is a reality television programme created by Raw Cut TV for British Sky Broadcasting and broadcast on Sky1, Sky2 and Pick TV, and also worldwide. Since Series 1 the show was narrated by Lee Boardman who played villain Jez Quigley in ITV soap Coronation Street. The 2nd half of series 7 was narrated by Claire Goose who played Inspector Rachel Weston in ITV1 police drama The Bill, The reason was unknown.
Road Wars is unlike other previous police programmes on Sky in that it followed the work of officers rather than simply playing police video clips. The programme has documented the changing tactics of criminals, perhaps most importantly their increasing violence and recklessness, and the response of the UK police forces. The programme also features some police videos from America.
For series 1-6, the programme followed the fourteen members of the Thames Valley Police's roads policing proactive unit (Road Crime Unit) - known as "Tango Victor". They are also said to be known to fellow officers as "Tango Vulture", taken from their callsign prefix TV (Tango Victor) and the joke that they swoop to steal arrests from other officers while they carried out their duties.

Stargate SG-1 (often abbreviated as SG-1) is a Canadian-American adventure and military science fiction television series and part of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's Stargate franchise. The show, created by Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner, is based on the 1994 feature film Stargate by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich. The television series was filmed in and around the city of Vancouver, Canada. In the United States, Showtime broadcast the first five seasons, from 1997 to 2002, and then the series moved to the Sci Fi Channel for its last five seasons, from 2002 to 2007. The final episode premiered on Sky1 in the United Kingdom on March 13, 2007, three months before its United States premiere. With ten seasons and 214 episodes, Stargate SG-1 surpassed The X-Files in 2007 as the longest-running North American science fiction series on television, before being surpassed by Smallville in 2011 with 218 episodes in ten seasons.
The story of Stargate SG-1 begins about a year after the events of the feature film, when the United States government learns that a network of ancient alien devices called Stargates connects a vast multitude of planets within our Milky Way galaxy, facilitating</desc>

Charmed is an American television series that originally aired from October 7, 1998, until May 21, 2006, on the now defunct The WB Television Network. The series was created by writer Constance M. Burge and was produced by Aaron Spelling and his Spelling Television company, with the show runner being writer-director Brad Kern.
The series follows the four Halliwell sisters—Prue, Piper, Phoebe and, later on in the series, Paige (who replaces Prue from season 4 onwards). The sisters are the culmination of the most powerful line of good witches in history and are known as The Charmed Ones in the supernatural community, whose prophesized destiny is to protect innocent lives against evil beings such as demons and warlocks. Each sister possesses unique magical powers that grow and evolve, while they attempt to hold normal working lives in modern day San Francisco. Keeping their supernatural identities separate and secret from their ordinary lives often becomes a challenge for them, with the exposure of magic having far-reaching consequences on their various relationships and resulting in a number of police and FBI investigations throughout the series.

Charmed is an American television series that originally aired from October 7, 1998, until May 21, 2006, on the now defunct The WB Television Network. The series was created by writer Constance M. Burge and was produced by Aaron Spelling and his Spelling Television company, with the show runner being writer-director Brad Kern.
The series follows the four Halliwell sisters—Prue, Piper, Phoebe and, later on in the series, Paige (who replaces Prue from season 4 onwards). The sisters are the culmination of the most powerful line of good witches in history and are known as The Charmed Ones in the supernatural community, whose prophesized destiny is to protect innocent lives against evil beings such as demons and warlocks. Each sister possesses unique magical powers that grow and evolve, while they attempt to hold normal working lives in modern day San Francisco. Keeping their supernatural identities separate and secret from their ordinary lives often becomes a challenge for them, with the exposure of magic having far-reaching consequences on their various relationships and resulting in a number of police and FBI investigations throughout the series.

Road Wars is a reality television programme created by Raw Cut TV for British Sky Broadcasting and broadcast on Sky1, Sky2 and Pick TV, and also worldwide. Since Series 1 the show was narrated by Lee Boardman who played villain Jez Quigley in ITV soap Coronation Street. The 2nd half of series 7 was narrated by Claire Goose who played Inspector Rachel Weston in ITV1 police drama The Bill, The reason was unknown.
Road Wars is unlike other previous police programmes on Sky in that it followed the work of officers rather than simply playing police video clips. The programme has documented the changing tactics of criminals, perhaps most importantly their increasing violence and recklessness, and the response of the UK police forces. The programme also features some police videos from America.
For series 1-6, the programme followed the fourteen members of the Thames Valley Police's roads policing proactive unit (Road Crime Unit) - known as "Tango Victor". They are also said to be known to fellow officers as "Tango Vulture", taken from their callsign prefix TV (Tango Victor) and the joke that they swoop to steal arrests from other officers while they carried out their duties.

Sexcetera is an American Playboy TV newsmagazine focused on human sexuality.
Having run over 80 episodes, since its launch in 1998, it is one of Playboy's longest-running series. Sexcetera features four to five "reports" per 1-hour episode.
The reports, which were filmed throughout the United States and in Europe, generally covered fetishes, adult expos or gatherings, current erotic trends, sex products (e.g. toys), pornographic celebrities, and tips for couples. Reporters presented their stories in a humorous style, and female correspondents often got naked during their own pieces.
Though no longer in production, reruns are still shown on Playboy TV, Sky Living and Pick TV. The network's current shows 69 Sexy Things 2 Do Before You Die and e-Rotic are built much around the same premise as the original Sexcetera.

Futurama is an American animated science fiction comedy sitcom created by Matt Groening and developed by Groening and David X. Cohen for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series follows the adventures of a late-20th-century New York City pizza delivery boy, Philip J. Fry, who, after being unwittingly cryogenically frozen for one thousand years, finds employment at Planet Express, an interplanetary delivery company in the retro-futuristic 31st century. The series was envisioned by Groening in the late 1990s while working on The Simpsons, later bringing Cohen aboard to develop storylines and characters to pitch the show to Fox.
In the United States, the series aired on Fox from March 28, 1999 to August 10, 2003 before ceasing production. Futurama was then aired in reruns on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim from 2003 to 2007, until the network's contract expired. It was revived in 2007 as four direct-to-video films; the last of the four was released in early 2009. Comedy Central entered into an agreement with 20th Century Fox Television to syndicate the existing episodes and air the films as 16 new, half-hour episodes.

Dog the Bounty Hunter is a reality television show on A&amp;E which chronicles Duane "Dog" Chapman's adventures as a fugitive recovery agent, or bounty hunter. With a few exceptions, the show takes place in Hawaii or Dog's home state of Colorado.
After eight seasons, on May 21, 2012 A&amp;E cancelled the series.
Duane "Dog" Chapman is joined by his business partner and wife, Beth Chapman; his grown sons Duane Lee Chapman, II and Leland Chapman, and his "brother," Tim "Youngblood" Chapman (despite having the same last name, Chapman and Tim are not biologically related). In Season 2, Dog's teenage daughter, "Baby" Lyssa Chapman returns home and becomes a member of the bounty-hunting team. Justin Bihag (son of longtime family friend Moon Bihag) also helps out during Season 1 and occasionally later.
The program spun off from Chapman's appearance on the show Take This Job, a program about people with unusual occupations. Both shows are produced for A&amp;E by Hybrid Films, a New York-based production company. Dog the Bounty Hunter captured an audience immediately by drawing viewers into the interaction of Chapman and his family_team, mixing street smarts, romance, arguments, teamwork,</desc>

The 2nd half of series 7 was narrated by Claire Goose who played Inspector Rachel Weston in ITV1 police drama The Bill, The reason was unknown.
Road Wars is unlike other previous police programmes on Sky in that it followed the work of officers rather than simply playing police video clips. The programme has documented the changing tactics of criminals, perhaps most importantly their increasing violence and recklessness, and the response of the UK police forces. The programme also features some police videos from America.
For series 1-6, the programme followed the fourteen members of the Thames Valley Police's roads policing proactive unit (Road Crime Unit) - known as "Tango Victor". They are also said to be known to fellow officers as "Tango Vulture", taken from their callsign prefix TV (Tango Victor) and the joke that they swoop to steal arrests from other officers while they carried out their duties.

SpongeBob SquarePants (often referred to simply as SpongeBob) is an American animated television series, created by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg. Much of the series centers on the exploits and adventures of the title character and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. The series' popularity has prompted the release of a media franchise, contributing to its position as Nickelodeon's highest rated show, the most distributed property of MTV Networks, and among Nicktoons' most watched shows. It is listed 15th in IGN's top 100 animated series list.
When Rocko's Modern Life ended in 1996, Hillenburg began working on SpongeBob SquarePants. He teamed up with several Nickelodeon veterans and Rocko crew members, including creative director Derek Drymon (Action League Now!, Hey Arnold!, and Rocko's Modern Life) writers and directors Sherm Cohen, and Dan Povenmire, writer Tim Hill, actor and writer Martin Olson, animation director Alan Smart (all from Rocko's Modern Life), and story editor Merriwether Williams (The Angry Beavers), who worked on the series for its first few seasons and switched to SpongeBob SquarePants in July 1999.

Punk'd is an American hidden camera-practical joke reality television series that first aired on MTV in 2003 and was created by Ashton Kutcher and Jason Goldberg, and produced and hosted by Ashton Kutcher. It bore a resemblance to both the classic hidden camera show Candid Camera and to TV's Bloopers &amp; Practical Jokes, which also featured pranks on celebrities. Being "punk'd" referred to being the victim of such a prank.
The series finale aired on MTV on May 29, 2007. The series culminated in early June with the Punk'd Awards.
After a five-year hiatus, the series was revived with a March 29, 2012 premiere. The revived series will be hosted by different celebrity guests each week.
Originally, Ashton Kutcher and MTV were developing a series called Harassment, a hidden camera show which would feature pranks on regular people. However, a January 2002 prank involving a fake dead body at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas backfired and the couple who were targets of the prank sued Kutcher, MTV and the hotel for $10 million. The concept was later retooled to involve celebrities instead. Pranks would be set at a variety of locations, public and private. The show's first prank was set at</desc>

South Park is an American animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone for the Comedy Central television network. Intended for mature audiences, the show has become famous for its crude language and dark, surreal humor that lampoons a wide range of topics. The ongoing narrative revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick—and their bizarre adventures in and around the titular Colorado town.
Parker and Stone, who met at college, developed the show from two animated shorts they created in 1992 and 1995. The latter became one of the first Internet viral videos, which ultimately led to its production as a series. South Park debuted in August 1997 with great success, consistently earning the highest ratings of any basic cable program. Subsequent ratings have varied but it remains one of Comedy Central's highest rated shows. It is Comedy Central's longest running program; a total of 230 episodes have aired, and the series is slated to run through at least 2016.

The Liver Birds is a British situation comedy, set in Liverpool, Merseyside, North-West of England, which aired on BBC1 from 1969 to 1978, and again in 1996. It was created by Carla Lane and Myra Taylor. The two Liverpudlian housewives had met at a local writers club and decided to pool their talents. Having been invited to London by Michael Mills (BBC Head of Comedy) and asked to write about two women sharing a flat, Mills brought in sitcom expert Sydney Lotterby to work with the writing team. Lotterby had previously worked with Eric Sykes, Sheila Hancock and on The Likely Lads. Carla Lane in fact wrote most of the episodes, Taylor co-writing only the first two series. The pilot was shown as an episode of Comedy Playhouse, the BBC's breeding ground for sitcoms, in April 1969.

The Liver Birds is a British situation comedy, set in Liverpool, Merseyside, North-West of England, which aired on BBC1 from 1969 to 1978, and again in 1996. It was created by Carla Lane and Myra Taylor. The two Liverpudlian housewives had met at a local writers club and decided to pool their talents. Having been invited to London by Michael Mills (BBC Head of Comedy) and asked to write about two women sharing a flat, Mills brought in sitcom expert Sydney Lotterby to work with the writing team. Lotterby had previously worked with Eric Sykes, Sheila Hancock and on The Likely Lads. Carla Lane in fact wrote most of the episodes, Taylor co-writing only the first two series. The pilot was shown as an episode of Comedy Playhouse, the BBC's breeding ground for sitcoms, in April 1969.

2point4 Children is a 1990s British sitcom that was created and written by Andrew Marshall. It follows the lives of the Porter family; an average family that is persistently faced with surreal situations and sheer bad luck.
The show was originally broadcast on BBC1 from 1991 to 1999, and ran for eight series, ending in a special Millennium edition that would be the last due to the death of Gary Olsen, who died from cancer in 2000. The show is now repeated regularly in the UK on G.O.L.D., and in Australia on UKTV.
The title of the show refers to the once average size of a UK family. There are two children in the Porter family, however Andrew Marshall has indicated that the father, Ben, could be considered almost another child, making up the "point four".
The show regularly picked up large audiences of up to 13 million in the 1990s, and the final episode was viewed by 9.03 million people.
In 1997 a remake of the show debuted in the Netherlands: 'Kees &amp; Co' starring Simone Kleinsma.

Waiting for God is a British sitcom that ran on BBC1 for five series from 1990 to 1994. It starred Stephanie Cole and Graham Crowden as two spirited residents of a retirement home who spend their time running rings around the home's oppressive management and their own families. It was written by Michael Aitkens.
The programme is still repeated in the UK on various channels. Seasons 1 through 5 have run (and in some cases continue to run) on PBS in the United States, and in New Zealand the show has aired various times since 2002.
Diana Trent (Stephanie Cole) - Diana is a curmudgeonly old woman who is constantly complaining about the state of the world. She is an atheist and often irritates Tom, who does believe in God. Trent used to be a photojournalist, specialising in combat zones.
Tom Ballard (Graham Crowden) - Tom is an optimistic, jolly old man who is new to the home. He suffers from mild dementia but he always tries to make the best of things. Sometimes, however, he goes against certain people such as Harvey Bains, who he often campaigns against and insults.

Keeping Up Appearances is a British sitcom created and written by Roy Clarke for the BBC. Centred on the life of eccentric, social-climbing snob Hyacinth Bucket (who insists that her surname is pronounced Bouquet), the sitcom portrays a social hierarchy-ruled British society. It jokes about a small obsessive world where a determined snobbish middle class woman desperately and continually looks for opportunities to climb the social ladder, despite being wedged between a working class background and upper class aspirations.
The show stars Patricia Routledge as Hyacinth Bucket, the pompous and self-serving central woman obsessed by perfection, image and etiquette, and also includes performances from Clive Swift as her calm, tolerant and long-suffering husband, Richard Bucket, and Josephine Tewson as her neighbour Elizabeth, a friendly pushover who is continually fearful of Hyacinth's presence. In Series Two Elizabeth's recently divorced brother Emmett (David Griffin) moves in with her. Judy Cornwell, Geoffrey Hughes and Mary Millar play Hyacinth's relatives, Daisy, Onslow her husband, and Rose, whose working-class presence she is continually fearful of.

Open All Hours is a BBC sitcom written by Roy Clarke which ran for four series (26 episodes in all over three broadcast runs) a first run in 1976, a second run in 1981, third in 1982 and a fourth in 1985, with a pilot episode from the Seven of One series in 1973. In 2004, the series was voted eighth in Britain's Best Sitcom.
The series features a small grocer's shop in Balby, a suburb of Doncaster in South Yorkshire. The owner, Albert Arkwright (Ronnie Barker), is a middle-aged miser with a stammer and a knack for being able to sell anything to any buyer, no matter how unwilling. His nephew Granville (David Jason), is his put-upon errand boy, whose attempts at a love-life or even just a meaningful social life fall flat. He blames his uncle, in particular, that, he has to be up early to open the shop, stay up late to close it with only an odd hour of free time and deliver large numbers of goods on a battered bicycle. Almost every mistake Arkwright makes is followed by a cry of "Gr-Granville! F-fetch yer cloth!". Granville was orphaned at an early age when Arkwright's sister died, leaving Arkwright to raise the boy. Arkwright often describes his sister as being extremely promiscuous,</desc>

Freebase:
Gimme Gimme Gimme is a BBC television sitcom by Tiger Aspect Productions that ran for three series between 1999 and 2001. It was written by Jonathan Harvey, who developed the series with Kathy Burke. It is loosely based on the play Abigail's Party by Mike Leigh.
The theme song was a cover of ABBA's "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)". The first series was shown on BBC Two, being deemed successful enough for the second and third series to be shown on BBC One.
Gimme Gimme Gimme stars comedienne and director Kathy Burke as loudmouthed Londoner Linda La Hughes and James Dreyfus as her gay flatmate, Tom. A modern twist on the traditional 'odd couple' format, much of Gimme Gimme Gimme's humour springs from its lubricious innuendo subplot, which springs from the mouths of both Tom and Linda.
Linda is characterised by her red perm, white glasses, and plump, lycra-clad figure. Boorish, unattractive Linda is convinced she is a "stunner"; in series three she is finally diagnosed with reversed body dysmorphic disorder. Linda shares a flat with homosexual actor Tom Farrell, played by James Dreyfus. It is suggested that Linda and Tom first met at a nightclub, bonded instantly (due to</desc>

Freebase:
Open All Hours is a BBC sitcom written by Roy Clarke which ran for four series (26 episodes in all over three broadcast runs) a first run in 1976, a second run in 1981, third in 1982 and a fourth in 1985, with a pilot episode from the Seven of One series in 1973. In 2004, the series was voted eighth in Britain's Best Sitcom.
The series features a small grocer's shop in Balby, a suburb of Doncaster in South Yorkshire. The owner, Albert Arkwright (Ronnie Barker), is a middle-aged miser with a stammer and a knack for being able to sell anything to any buyer, no matter how unwilling. His nephew Granville (David Jason), is his put-upon errand boy, whose attempts at a love-life or even just a meaningful social life fall flat. He blames his uncle, in particular, that, he has to be up early to open the shop, stay up late to close it with only an odd hour of free time and deliver large numbers of goods on a battered bicycle. Almost every mistake Arkwright makes is followed by a cry of "Gr-Granville! F-fetch yer cloth!". Granville was orphaned at an early age when Arkwright's sister died, leaving Arkwright to raise the boy. Arkwright often describes his sister as being extremely promiscuous,</desc>

Freebase:
Gimme Gimme Gimme is a BBC television sitcom by Tiger Aspect Productions that ran for three series between 1999 and 2001. It was written by Jonathan Harvey, who developed the series with Kathy Burke. It is loosely based on the play Abigail's Party by Mike Leigh.
The theme song was a cover of ABBA's "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)". The first series was shown on BBC Two, being deemed successful enough for the second and third series to be shown on BBC One.
Gimme Gimme Gimme stars comedienne and director Kathy Burke as loudmouthed Londoner Linda La Hughes and James Dreyfus as her gay flatmate, Tom. A modern twist on the traditional 'odd couple' format, much of Gimme Gimme Gimme's humour springs from its lubricious innuendo subplot, which springs from the mouths of both Tom and Linda.
Linda is characterised by her red perm, white glasses, and plump, lycra-clad figure. Boorish, unattractive Linda is convinced she is a "stunner"; in series three she is finally diagnosed with reversed body dysmorphic disorder. Linda shares a flat with homosexual actor Tom Farrell, played by James Dreyfus. It is suggested that Linda and Tom first met at a nightclub, bonded instantly (due to</desc>

The Liver Birds is a British situation comedy, set in Liverpool, Merseyside, North-West of England, which aired on BBC1 from 1969 to 1978, and again in 1996. It was created by Carla Lane and Myra Taylor. The two Liverpudlian housewives had met at a local writers club and decided to pool their talents. Having been invited to London by Michael Mills (BBC Head of Comedy) and asked to write about two women sharing a flat, Mills brought in sitcom expert Sydney Lotterby to work with the writing team. Lotterby had previously worked with Eric Sykes, Sheila Hancock and on The Likely Lads. Carla Lane in fact wrote most of the episodes, Taylor co-writing only the first two series. The pilot was shown as an episode of Comedy Playhouse, the BBC's breeding ground for sitcoms, in April 1969.
The series charted the ups and downs of two 'dolly birds' sharing a flat on Huskisson Street, in Liverpool. The series concentrated on the problems encountered by the two young single women when dealing with boyfriends, work, parents and each other. Dressed in the best 1970s fashions they looked for romance in a loose female equivalent of The Likely Lads.

The programme's tagline is The show that helps you find hidden treasures in your home, and then sells them for you at auction.
In the show, the presenter visits a family's house to find out what they need to raise money for. They then explore the house and its surroundings, finding antiques and valuing them, with the help of experts. The family then goes to auction with the aim of making their financial target. The auction never takes place on the same day as the rummage; often it can take place several weeks later.
In celebrity episodes, the well-known guest contributors rummage around their homes for antiques to be valued and sold at auction. The celebrity donates the proceeds to his or her charity of choice. As of February 2010, 86 episodes have been made and a total of £91,266 has been raised for charities in the UK and abroad.

Extreme Makeover: Home Edition (EM:HE) is an American reality television series providing home renovations for less fortunate families and community schools etc. The show is hosted by former model, carpenter and veteran television personality Ty Pennington.
Each episode features a family that has faced some sort of recent or ongoing hardship such as a natural disaster or a family member with a life-threatening illness, in need of new hope. The show's producers coordinate with a local construction contractor, which then coordinates with various companies in the building trades for a makeover of the family's home. This includes interior, exterior and landscaping, performed in seven days while the family is on vacation (paid for by the show's producers) and documented in the episode. If the house is beyond repair, they replace it entirely. The show's producers and crew film set and perform the makeover but do not pay for it. The materials and labor are donated. Many skilled and unskilled volunteers assist in the rapid construction of the house.
EM:HE is considered a spinoff of Extreme Makeover, an earlier series providing personal makeovers (often including plastic surgery) to</desc>

Doctor Who is a British science fiction television programme produced by the BBC. The programme depicts the adventures of a Time Lord—a time travelling, humanoid alien with two hearts known as the Doctor. He explores the universe in his TARDIS—a sentient, telepathic time machine that flies through time and space. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, a common sight in 1963, when the series first aired. Along with a succession of companions, the Doctor faces a variety of foes while working to save civilisations, help ordinary people, and right wrongs.
The show has received recognition from critics and the public as one of the finest British television programmes, including the 2006 British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series and five consecutive (2005–10) wins at the National Television Awards under Russell T Davies' reign as Executive Producer. In 2011, Matt Smith became the first Doctor to be nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.

Produced by Talkback Thames and shown to air from 2002, the basic premise of the show is that a person_family wishes to relocate from their current city home to a more peaceful and rural retreat. It is then the job of the show's presenter to find four houses for the family to view via laptop computer in their own homes. The family must then choose two out of the four houses to go and view for themselves. In addition, there is also the option of choosing the</desc>

Doctor Who is a British science fiction television programme produced by the BBC. The programme depicts the adventures of a Time Lord—a time travelling, humanoid alien with two hearts known as the Doctor. He explores the universe in his TARDIS—a sentient, telepathic time machine that flies through time and space. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, a common sight in 1963, when the series first aired. Along with a succession of companions, the Doctor faces a variety of foes while working to save civilisations, help ordinary people, and right wrongs.
The show has received recognition from critics and the public as one of the finest British television programmes, including the 2006 British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series and five consecutive (2005–10) wins at the National Television Awards under Russell T Davies' reign as Executive Producer. In 2011, Matt Smith became the first Doctor to be nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. The programme is listed in the Guinness World Records as the longest-running science fiction television show in the world and as the "most successful" science fiction series of all time—based on its over-all</desc>

Primeval is a British science fiction television programme produced for ITV by Impossible Pictures.

On 29 September 2009, it was announced that a deal had been struck between ITV, BBC Worldwide, Watch, Impossible Pictures and the German broadcaster ProSieben to produce two new series of the show for transmission in 2011.

Hollywood Treasure is a weekly, American, reality television series that began airing on SyFy, October 27, 2010, which follows a Hollywood, California-based appraiser named Joe Maddalena and his team as they track down, appraise and help auction off valuable film, television and pop culture memorabilia.
David Hinckley of the New York Daily News says, "Hollywood Treasure will intrigue film junkies and memorabilia collectors. For the rest of us, it's breezy amusement about a world that, like the movies themselves, we will always be watching from the audience."
To Brian Lowry of Variety, "It's just that we've seen this movie (or rather, reality-TV show) before, dozens of times, in more glamorous settings. And having each half-hour (two will air back to back) conclude with an auction doesn't really foster much suspense."

Primeval: New World is a forthcoming Canadian science fiction television programme, set in Vancouver, British Columbia, created by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens. A co-production between Impossible Pictures and Omni Film Productions for Space, the show is a spin-off of the British series Primeval. It will be broadcast in the United Kingdom on Watch, and on Space in Canada. As with Primeval, the premise of Primeval: New World involves a team of scientists who have to deal with animals from the past and future that travel through time to the present day through anomalies. The tone of the series will be "older, darker and scarier" than the original.
In the Primeval universe, animals from the past and future travel through time to present day Britain through anomalies, fictional phenomena which act as portals through time. A team of government scientists attempts to covertly capture the animals and return them to their home geologic eras while preventing the public from becoming aware of the existence of the anomalies. In Primeval: New World, set in Vancouver, British Columbia, a team of scientists investigate the opening of anomalies in northern latitudes.
